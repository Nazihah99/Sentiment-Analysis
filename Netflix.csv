Account sharing crackdown üëé
"Families live in different houses, don't be cheap."
oml where do i start! i love netflix so muchh!!!
Needs improvement
Great for movie night with your Babe !
Netflix does not honor it's own terms and conditions. Netflix does not provide the services paid for. So not give them your credit card information.
"After enjoying watching my old favorite Nickelodeon show from when I was a kid, I came up with more classic TV shows! Why not add ""Drake & Josh"" next? I LOVE THAT SHOW SO MUCH! Also, for movies, I have another idea: ""Casper, the Friendly Ghost""!!! Just like ""Matilda"", the older shows/movies will forever be the best in my opinion. ü§©üòä"
Netflix is the only one who has a great day
Someday netflix app will dissappear because of loklok app....because loklok app has netflix original series...and also free...why netflix app has payment....i hope you sue the developer of the loklok app...i love netflix but why loklok app stealing your copyright.....please action for this before its too late
I'm giving this app a 1 star because it never fails every show Netflix makes always turns one of it's characters trans or gay. EVERY SINGLE ONE. CAN'T Y'ALL JUST MAKE A SHOW WITHOUT SOME SEXUAL ORIENTATION INVOLVED!
"Gone, deleted signed up for cable because it's now cheaper"
"""Love is sharing a password."" -Netflix 2017 ""Don't share passwords"" -Netflix 2023 Love is dead, according to Netflix"
"Password sharing disabled , I gave my primary account to my nice and nephews, tried to log out on the app and create a new account on my Android phone. Nope. I was with Netflix since DVD, I hope they go bankrupt. Set up a second account, on my original, and the phone number wasn't texted for verification . Makes me miss Blockbuster and I now realize why the creators of Avatar the last Airbender left."
It's good but consumes a lot of battery! can you please develop a liter version also?
Way too expensive for 1 household especially when they don't have any good content. Kid's will miss it but they'll live.
They delete all the good shows and leave the not good shows
Leaving this 1 star review because I oppose the password sharing crackdown. That's all
"They first sell you the share account, and now they need to profit. They are not a trustable company."
It has anime that's why it's a great app
Due to the new rules. Greedy.
very good movies !!!
It would be nice if they didn't take out their only good shows

Used to love it but now so money hungry. Raising prices non stop
Movie Queen Cleopatra ugly and disgusting
The crackdown speaks volumes

Not good. Can no longer watch Netflix away from home due to the new rules. The app is essentially useless. Why have a multiple screen plan when you all must watch on the same network?
"Can not see Audio Languages option when scrolling/browsing Straight away. Hard to find it without playing first. Too many things being churned out to throw all at you and hoping few will stick. Recommendations is okayish. I like great documentaries but they mostly USA focused. Only Like and dislike button, there is no way to type feedback/reviews."
"Apps ok. The Company however is more worried lining their own pockets. Deleting the App, Canceling the subscription. Shameful."
Adds are less
What the hell mn it auto Pays Using Gcashhh how to remove my account????? Stupid Netflix
Can't watch on more then one tv at once. waste of time and money don't bother getting Netflix
"I can watch Crave, YouTube, Britbox, and Disney on my android box, but not Netflix, because Netflix insists on only allowing devices they vet to use it. What a dumb system. When push comes to shove, Netflix is the first service I would drop to save money, and that's due to their braindead policy of preventing devices that are more than capable of high quality streaming from running the app. I know I'm not the only one."
I'll give it a 5stAr it's a really good app You guys need to try this it's very convenient
"Netflix was already falling behind other services for me, they put the final nail in the coffin with password sharing being taken away"
When I was watching squid game S1 E4 I didn't know it was National shooting air day
Amazing!
Great
I'd like to give this less than 1 star due to the recent changes to password sharing.
Net
"Goodbye, Netflix. I was a loyal customer for 13 years. You have just crapped on me. What I do with my password is up to me. I hope your business goes the way of Bud Lite. You went woke years ago anyway. I won't be back again. Never. You lost me forever. I have convinced others to also cancel and will continue to make other's leave. #cancelnetflix"
Love it
This app is so good
"'My List' is now an actual list instead of being a grid of thumbnails, which I don't like. To make it worse it's default sorted by 'Suggested' instead of date added, and switches back to the default when you leave the page."
It is gud
Let Netflix have all films
I'm a first-time user
"Bloatware for me, everytime I restart my phone THIS show again. Still alive after restarting my phone."
Very good
"My wife wants to finish a series, but them you are done. You DO NOT get to tell me who my family is, or who gets to watch the services I pay for. You could have required a simple password change to drop unshared accounts. Instead you decided to take away my ability to share it with people I like to provide for. You suck and I hope your business fails. Screw you."
Bad
This makes me get angry sometimes not all movies are on this app we are paying for even telegram channels are better that this is like I will remove my card
Very good
"app is good and user friendly, I've increased to 4 stars as the content has improved tremendously compared to a few years ago. Also happy with the floating screen, would be helpful if you could change the Auto next feature in app"
No more sharing lol
Good
Useless app since I can't log in unless I'm at home Infront of my big screen tv....... This is literally worse then cable at this point since we don't get daily new content... I'll give it 2 months before I cancel my subscription and just use my free plan from TMobile.
Not worth it anymore.
films
Canceled after 10 years. I paid $20 every month for years to be able to watch 4 screens at a time and now you're telling me I can't use my own Netflix outside of the house. There are better options for streaming that cost less and offer more.
its bin a geat time watchig netflix
It's satisfying
It's the best but the paidmet is an
Great Awesome App
No HDR support for red magic 7 so only 2 stars.

Fantastic
Awesome
Tons of great content!
Love it grate app
Now that it can't be shared with multiple people I will no longer get this whats next pay even more or watch a ad every 5 mins but you a company so all you guys care about is money
Very good
I am a lid and my parents will not let me log in so sorry
Absolutely terrible.
"My opinion is that Netflix mostly has very low quality content, that is to say the least. I recommend staying away entirely from Netflix."
"The app works and there are some good shows on here. Netflix not caving and removing Dave Chappelle was a great thing, but I cannot overlook allowing content such as ""cuties"" on the platform"
I like Netflix it's a good I love everybody much would like it dreadout delight
Superb
Its the best and please dont remove old anime!!!!
"Netflix keeps raising the price and just removed account sharing ($8 per month for each shared location now). It just isn't close to worth the cost, thus I'm canceling my subscription. There are plenty of better options."
BRING BACK MADOKA MAGICA RAHHHHH
"I love this app, BUT it's been freezing/crashing lately. I even uninstalled/reinstalled it, but it still has the same issue(s). I just did a factory reset to my Chromebook, and I'm STILL dealing with the same thing (and it's only with this app)! *angry emoji* All that to say this: that's why I rated it the way I did."
I like this App
Very good
Baaaaaaad as hell
I have opened but it is not opening and I have I have written so many times but it is not opening so I don't know what to do.
The new update lags too much. I can't watch it on my phone nor TV.
Waste app
5 STARS always happy....EDIT=WHEN CAN I GO ON NETFLIX AND READ THE DESCRIPTION OF THE MOVIE/TV SHOW WITHOUT IT JUMPIN RIGHT TO THE MOVIE....I CHANGED THAT OPTION IN SETTINGS....CHANGE THIS PLEASE....üòµ
"Eh! I got this just because verizon provided a promotion, but i do not see what the big deal is the shows are movies are not great. I much prefer to pay for HULU, amazon prime....or any others."

"I don't know why I'm unable to watch videos on Netflix, when I'm about to open any video it shows there is a problem playing the video ,please try again .reason i Don't know"

Life Must Be easy When you have a subscription of Netflix
"Household? HOUSEHOLD?! You are on a slippery slope, sliding down & picking up speed. You changed your UI, you force advertisements of your terrible shows that would NOT fit my algorithm, & now you want us to set a ""household"". No, I don't think so."

"I love Netflix, though they could do live streem TV too."
Wish I could give it zero stars. Netflix has been going down hill for a long time but now they've just lost it. There are so many other streaming services that I can use that are 100% better. Bye bye Netflix üëã üòò

I guess it's time to send my Netflix sub to the subscription graveyard. Farewell old friend. You're not worth 50% more than you were a month ago.
Can u please translate audio in to filipino languages. Too expensive but there is no filipino langauge

On the OnePlus smartphone it has low resolution stream even if the WiFi is fast why am I watching a 4K movie on a big screen phone with 720p ?
"Password crackdown connects your account to your IP/wifi. So, it was recognized as not being the correct location when we streamed in our car tv via our phone hotspot. Pay for 2 streaming screens. I should be able to watch 2 screens wherever"
Wow I love Netflix
New Wi-Fi systems terrible and makes no sense. I pay for a family account your family should be able to use it. We already pay to have a number of screens
Duidiskeje
"I travel for work and mostly use a hotspot. Having to cancel because it's almost useless to me now. I also shared this with my grandmother who is inept when it comes to streaming services. It was hard enough to get her to break away from cable and now she will probably go back. I get wanting to limit account sharing, but you should be allowed to at least share with one person outside your household for no upcharge. Are the CEOs of Netflix really struggling not bad? Only one plane this year?"
Good app
I just love this app it so fast
Very nice app to watch movie.
unlimited movies and series on Netflix
Not yet!
So you're telling me I have to pay extra if I want to watch my account on my phone while I'm on the go???? I'll pass on that. Why would I sit at home on my couch with phone connected to wifi doesn't that defeat the purpose of being mobile.
"Historical facts and people curved so to be politically correct. One day there will be black Lincoln. Bye Netflix, cancelling due lack of respect."

I don't know let's try app üíÅ

That's grateful app
Dear Netflix I will support your cause because you gave Dave Chepppelle his moeny back. Not because I like him but because it was the right thing to do. Good job poeple
I can't even let my elderly mother use my Netflix now thanks
"No way to see entire library easily. No way to remove movies from your list, without having to go to their info and selecting list. Why not a more elegant design. Like allowing multiple selection of movies on your list."
Cannot download anymore.
"Removing after many years. I used to love Netflix, but your new rule made me cancel my subscription after 8 years."
Awesome I like Netflix really good than others nowadays best of luck for the makers and all team members of Netflix.
"Naruto shippuuden Doesn't exist in netflix Bangladesh server,"

I could say many things. But I will not. I would not be using their services. Hulu is MUCH better.
Bad asf
Not working on my phone getting code
Nothing like FREE NETFLIX tried to log in a million times And directed to pay via credit card.. I'm totally disappointed.
Installed your new update on andriod ... App crashes every time I open app. I Also just paid for renewal membership too. So what a waste of $17 as I can't use app on phone. How surprising the app suddenly crashes ü§î no one at netflix cares remotely about their customers.
"Had Netflix since it was available in my country, about 5 years now. Content has gotten worse over time ( not entirely netflix issue, but the whole streaming industry ). Now you shot yourself in the foot with this password sharing ban. What happened to ""sharing is caring"" ? Well done, canceled the subscription, not coming back."
"This app is very nice, and shows lots of interesting movie the problem is I don't know if it's my Netflix but I can't find the funny scenes option."
Shame on Netflix.
Great selections
Excellent
Cause I like it ok

Nice one you can watch new things an enjoyable every time or hour
"THEY SHOULD LET IS WATCH WHATEVER WE WANT. NOT EVERY MOVIE OR TV SHOW COMES OUT HERE. EVERY MOVIE OR TV SHOW MADE SHOULD BE AVAILABLE ON HERE ESPECIALLY AFTER PAYING FOR THIS APP & SHOULD NEVER BE TAKEN OFF. IT'S A GREAT APP TO WATCH MOVIES, JUST NEEDS UPGRADING."
Good luck with everything
Greedy
Very nice apppp
Total sucks
No latest movies. All are boring. Need latest movies 2023. Specially hindi movie. üò°
"Everytime you leave the app, even for a few seconds, you lose progress of where you were and the movie/show starts over or goes back 30-45 minutes. Every other streaming service have figured it out except Netflix"
Please accept the payment through rupay debitcard... Our banks doesn't issue mastercard debit card now

I am visually impaired person and I cannot afford Netflix premium so I want to request Netflix should free for visually impaired persons thank you
Very easy to follow.
None of the videos are playing....very sad netflix.
Netflix is getting a 1 star. Ive been using this app since 2009 for $7.99&8.99 and then all of a sudden its $15.99?! I was not paying that for netflix as im on a fixed income with kids. They have locks on shows and movies that are already saved to my list üòØ I'm not paying for nothing I can watch free on my firestick . Everything on Netflix is on my firestick for FREE üíØü•∞
Installation issue and also updateing it's new version
Aok
LET ME DELETE THE APP I DON'T WANR YOUR STUPID BLOATWHERE

love netflix
It's amazing üíó‚ù§Ô∏è
Thinking to unsubscribe. Most of the series are on other language that we can't understand and it's really useless. Rather we enjoy watching or keep reading caption.
While I'm using Netflix its suddenly stop working still now app doesn't work
good app for your favourite film download i love it
Would be 5 stars but took 2 stars away due to download speed of movies. I can download 5 movies on other platforms for the 1 movie I can download on Netflix.
Good
Keep increasing money and it will be a goodbye after 12 years. Enough is enough
cannot change download location galaxy tab a8 please fix your app geez ita annoying

not many good shows anymore(except for breaking bad ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è) and also expensive and also can only have like 2 devices
canceled my subscription!! you should cancel yours too! nothing on here is worth paying for and they have made it where only you can watch it at your own house!!! F YOU NETFLIX!!! For those who don't know MAX is amazing and it has everything that Netflix has and much much more!!
Continuously showing your account on hold..even after updating payment option multiple times.. Netflix sending messages to pay for bigger pack.
Best movie app
idk why it keeps freezing
superb
No sharing huh
Good
"Not worth watching now cause they always put movies that are in chinese, french and other languages now, at least translate the sound to english, who wants to watch it with french and read so many times it's distracting, thats why I don't pay for it, I can watch my movies free somewhere else, I can still watch half of these movies but before I use to like it until french movies got in. Only thing that is good is the movie picks are great and the organization but too much french films to me."

The household ruling of netflix sux. and the only ones using a family acct. is my Fianc√© so how are we supposed to share the app in which we are paying both. this is a complete L on Netflix.

"Great way to be military friendly. Bend someone over and screw them for every dime because the are not ""within the house hold"" blow it out your corporate pie whole you greedy bastards."
Ok
Discriminates against military families with their new password policy. Now military has to pay for and cancel two accounts each time their spouse deploys or comes come. It's a joke. Their a joke.
"Overall statement is that this company is selfish and doesnt listen to what their consumers want. Its like you do the complete opposite and wonder why you're losing subscribers. The unnecessary canceling shows, unfunding animation, and stoping password share between families in households and making the service more exspensive at the point people should just go back to cable..its ridiculous."
"It's good. You can have more then one profile. You can download movies and shows to watch when offline, and you can watch a large variety of shows. It sucks how they remove shows and movies so quickly sometimes, and how Netflix has become so greedy cause billions aren't enough, so now we have to pay to share accounts. Wow thanks mate. Greedy people."
new update only 1/2 show
I hate it when it tells you that you have to go to a a website and finish this extra and I can't watch my shows is anointing
Good
H888887
Terrible selection of shows and movies. Now I can't even watch anywhere but my own living room? There are many better streaming options out there at this point.
Netflix is great. But they really need to get all the seasons for the shows they have. I hate when they do that. They focus more on their Netflix originals then the shows they've had since the dawn of time. There is way too many shows that are missing several seasons.
Please give us some new movies we can't get lot's of movies if we can't get what we want to watch than we think that no use for recharging
Bad
"Thanks for removing the Cast option (ironic). The new UI is terrible, it's hard to navigate, things don't make sense. Don't waste your money in UCR it's not working. - I want to play a video, I tap on it and plays on a small window and muted (?) - I hit the play and then it really starts. - You don't follow the standards for casting. Whole app & in video. YouTube and many others do. I'm sorry to say it, I'm a long term customer and the service is not what it used to be."
you don't even deserve a star I can't create an account I hate you
Ez duz it
Like itüëç
After I installed the app on my phone it stopped working on my rouku
"I didn't think Netflix could get any worse, but this so-called ""password sharing"" crackdown is a new start of desperate lows for corporations. I have told them to remove the extra screens I wanted and was part-paying for, but ultimately, my family has subsequently cancelled their subscription due to your poor consumer policies as of late. You've dug your own grave, sadly."
Very nice
"""DEVICE FAILURE OCCURED PLEASE TRY AGAIN."" It's been doing this for 3 days on my phone at least it works on tv. Can't believe I'm paying for this -_-"
Good
Worst app ever. Keeps giving device failure error on my galaxy s23.
"Corporate greed. Bave been a netflix user for 10 years, back when they had starz and actual good stuff to watch at just $7 a month. I cancelled and deleted the app because i was paying $15 for the same plan and there's nothing good on netflix to watch anymore. And now they are going after password sharing, as if i used the app enough to even warrant 1 subscription, they want me to pay for 2. I remeber netflix tweeting this one valentine's day, ""love is sharing your password"". Lol not anymore."
"Great, I like watching different varieties of movies and shows üëå"
Just not the same. The while cracking down on people who share their accounts is actually the dumbest thing you could have done.
"Used to be the best, now it's just another woke political platform. You can't escape politics anymore especially when a network gets as giant as Netflix. Can't watch anymore vegan, trans, non binary government subsidized, race focused, women empowerment, teen aged sex related shows. Can we just watch something light hearted and not so politically influenced? I had to cancel and save the $10 a month. I'd rather become an extrovert and start talking to people again."
"I love the ways this app has a smart download so if you watch one it downloads another one. It is not slow and has some of the best movies. It has horror, comedy, romantic,and so much more.there is a kids profile so that you can watch kids movies or if you are like for a family movie."
I have never thought that this app is the father of entertainment you get everything here like everything....I am greatly impressed....love it‚ù§Ô∏èüòäüëç
I'm not gonna pay to set through ads at reasonable price for streaming service. I'm definitely not gonna pay double to do without ads greedy piglets
"Greedy ceo dad lives in guam, and I can't afford Netflix, so I used his till now 30$ for Netflix with no good shows, not worth it"
"Have to pay for features I don't want for HD content. They cancel any show that remotely doesn't stay top 5 in the country, ruined series like the witcher by butchering source material, and I pay for 10 screens just to watch 4k even though nobody needs that. Awful to see a company become so much like what they destroyed to get their success."
This app sucks and what they did was awful. I wish it was zero star to give.
Good
I already Paid for my subscription and now they wa t me to pay again. It was take. Off my husband's cash app card. Now they want me to upgrade to 22.99 a month but I haven't even gotten. To watch my first movie that I've already purchased! I'm really passed off about it! It would really help me put if I felt like I was being double charged. Netflix has been AMAZING for me in the past but not when your trying to charge me twice!!! Please fix this issue. Thank you Netflix PLZ FIX THIA ISSUE PLZ!
"Zero stars. Netflix has become just as greedy as Big Cable, or more! One account should be per FAMILY not household. Almost every person in my family lives alone. Now Netflix wants $8 from EACH of us, when it used to be $8 for ALL of us!"
Great
Nice app
Good
Inside job season 2 when
"Me and my boyfriend wanted to ""netflex and chill"" but it takes forever to load. We did the dead anyway so its okay."
"They started charging if we live in separate households. Netflix sucks now, and there are better streaming services out there."
Had to unsalted my Netflix as it won't let use it
I gave Netflix a 1 because sometimes when I press on a TV show/movie it takes me to another tv show that I was watching previously. And it's gotten to point where it's very annoying.
I want to be able to prevent the share my personal information right off the bat
Netflix slow update fc
A rip off
Lovely apps
Not friendly user
GooD Time pass.
Very Bad
"Even though there is already a limit to how many people can watch at once, now I can't watch from different locations."
Have been a netflix subscriber since they sent out dvd's and didn't have a streaming service. Have tolerated their almost annual increase in rates for decreasing quality content but when they want me to pay more to use since I travel for work it's time to call it quits and just use the other streaming services.
"Bad, bad, bad, good bye Netflix!"
"Netflix used to be a great app with good options & a fast load rate. Now they seem to be more concerned with making sure you aren't sharing your password than making sure you can even get into the app & watch shows. Every time I try to log in, I get an error message & then when I finally do get in, the shows only play for about 5-10 minutes before they freeze (if I can get them to load in the first place) & I have to exit the app & start over. Why am I paying for this again? Do better, Netflix."
The operation system is veery bad
"If there was a choice to rate zero, I would. Sadly Netflix is an overrated app. There's no good stuff on it. The interesting stuff are nowhere to be found. Tufia!!!!"

"I really love this app, just I wish it had a machanic where it would have the shows and movies you wanted to watch on there for a longer amout of time, not just like a month or two. Other than that, It is a really good app to watch shows and movies."
Spreading lies
We enjoyed the movie would like Netflix.
There's no ads Btw the best
One of the best apps out there for streaming stuff on. Would recommend to anyone. Suitable for all ages.
good shows and easy to use
This is a bad app how can I change my plan ????
Recent policy changes
It helps me when i am beptsert
Very easy to use. Just setting it up.

"If you don't want us to share accounts than make it worth our money. Everything on there is remakes or reruns. Joke of an ""service"" app."
Well bye bye to my netflix account lol hope you enjoy loosing viewers based off your new methods
Bye bye Netflix. Putting a stop to password sharing was the final straw.

"Instead of just switching all policies to the 20 dollar one, we are forced to spend money on 10 streaming platforms. This is cable wity extra steps. And more expensive. They made billions and haven't put out anything great in years"

"Netflix but it doesn't have some Netflix shows like Punisher and Daredevil, I mean WOW."
"The household sharing policies are a load of rubbish, will be unsubscribing from my subscription. Greedy corporations will continue to be greedy in the endless search for profits at the detriment of the end user experience"

I pay to use Netflix where I want and on what I want and now Netflix thinks they can tell you how and where you can use this none premium site! Such a joke and will cancel this subscription. Netflix is now a garbage website for streaming TV and movies... Nobody and no company is going to tell me how to use the things I pay for with my. Such a joke!!!

Best application for movies
Amazing

"There's no good shows/series or good movies, they should come up with better shows/series and movies, otherwise, Netflix is going down."
Why did they remove good anime nd movies here.
"Enshittification struck hard, this service is imploding."
Love the movies they offer so easy to use
What the hell is wrong with the app??!! I'm not able to watch anything!! The moment I start any video it automatically stops!? It's so frustrating! I even updated the app but to no use. FIX IT.
"I think they want me to cancel my account , lately they have been worse than hulu or prime trying to tell me I can't watch Netflix at both of my homes or when out and about on my mobile devices there is a screen that keeps popping up saying so making me think of canceling I have had this account more than 10 years but I think they are getting tired of me being a customer as much as verizon has."
"Thanks Netflix, for making it hard to enjoy your shows anywhere!"
"OMG! This app is so so so, you know no words to describe it because it has all movies and shows. I give this app 5 üåü."
Awesome
Delete the movie of Cleopatra

Video struck and playing sound slowly..Fix it
Not good

Had netflix for years even through the prices increases but cancelled due to new password rules

"I've had Netflix since It first came out I paid for four screens now Netflix is telling me that anyone outside of my household can't watch and if they do I have to pay more I am already paying you more so I'm cancelling, Netflix is digging themselves into a hole like every other streaming company Good thing I have a mountain of DVDs to watch Good luck going broke Netflix"
"Disappointing, This app is the most expensive of all streaming apps without the variety of movies that other streaming apps have. And now the new foolishness. Having to pay additional for my child to use my password is ridiculous."
"There is some issue with my account I am unable to watch anything from last 5 days, earlier it was working fine. I have logged my friend's account and that is working fine. Already tried some basic tourbleshoot."

Absolutely terrible cuts half my screen off the image has shifted to the left but the buttons are still on the same place getting lots of pop ups saying it's not responding and now I have to pay extra for certain family members to use it too think I'll stick with prime video
i like your content
Worst app
Cool app

Great
Really bad in every thing Do not ever think about subscribing or even downloading
I mean the only thing I have to say which is abit annoying is how some films get taken off there but apart from that omg it's shamazing!!
Nice üôÇ But It's very Expensive Common Man Can't Afford It in Pakistan.
"Can't even log in anymore without jumping through hoops because GOD FORBID families share with each other. I'll not be giving the greedy vultures my money again until this issue is fixed. There are plenty of streaming services out there that don't do this. KICK ROCKS, NETFLIX."
Scumbagging your BEST customers because your multimillion dollar company is getting GREEDY. Looks like Disney+ Hulu and roku will be getting my BUISNESS and hope you SUFFER for your corporate greed! OH AND I'm back to mention The better of them Amazon prime video.. Netflix is now Useless to Americans
Due to the new regulation about the family account.
I decided to pay for this monthly but i cant find many of the movies that i am supposed to in this app bcs of Region something if u want my money Than make it available for all countrys so i dont pay for nothing üò°
Bogus. No timely updates.
Very good
Why must I pay no manüò≠
Netflix not working from last 3 days. It gets stuck on first page everytime which is really frustrating. Pl check if there is any issue regarding the recent update.

The anime on Netflix is not quite good
Nice
You better love it if you're installing it because once you install it you can't remove it. Such bullsh@t..
Long time customer. Like Netflix alont. But you raise the rates again. I'm canceling my account. There are too many free apps like tubi.. and it has live TV. Hope you get the hint. Update now your trying to limit my premium account. .
"Would have given a 5 star rating but most of my favourite anim√©s are either not complete or not even there E.g demon slayer seasons 2 and 3 aren't there And Boruto isn't even there I feel like i wasted my money But asides that, everything is fineüòä"
Can't make an account
It's ok
"They start this standard with ads plan and you can't watch their full content because of 'licensing issues', why did you have to start such plans when one can't have access to all content? Isn't it discrimination & greedy tactic. Netflix is going downhill & such bunch of retards at the helm making decisions like this, Nobody want to be in this platform anymore. I would rather choose Peacock, paramount plus or tubi where there content is great & full access for lower price than Netflix."
Canceled! I TRAVEL FOR WORK. Telling me I can't watch 20 dollar Netflix UHD when at home only. Never again. Enjoy having no one to watch ur boring shows. BYE

"Waste of money, paying so much monthly and they can't even fix the android tv app. I've been having this issue for over a year. Every time I want to watch something on Netflix I have to turn my TV off on the wall. Wait for 30 seconds and then reboot my TV and try Netflix again. I don't have this issue with Plex, Paramount, Disney, prime video or Apple TV."
I need more anime in it
No complants
Downloaded movies disappear when you exit the app and you have to redownload EVERY TIME. No watching anything offline
"Love a streaming service that cancels 90% of their own content & then jacks up the price. Also, I can't uninstall it which is very annoying"

While paying for monthly subscription i paid through UPI and not through app. I didn't get money back. I had called up on service help number. They just told can't do anything and wait money will get refunded in 8-10 days. But no refund even after 18 days
U take a lot of money 4 nothing and 80% of Ur movies is disgusting

I've always been under my dad's account and he travels all the time for work and I don't live with him. With the new password sharing ban I encouraged him to cancel his account because there's chances he'd be gone for over 31 days and I can't travel to his house once a month since we live in different cities. He cancelled fast and I told him I'd find another service for us to share.
Nice
Good
Asking money
Best
I have tried to uninstall Netflix app from my phone it doesn't have the option to do so...tried to delete but it still there its stuck natter what lol
Finally fixed the app so it's a bit easier to find your list and useful content. Now if only there was a better selection of actual content instead of the one or two non renewed gems. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
"I love this app !!!! So much it is soo chill so many TV shows to pick from I just get lost in the moment of netflix ! Films , documentarys , movies, TV shows and much more check it out yourself üòÅ What I LIKE the most is make your own profile so if you had a kid under 6 you could make the profile to only have choices of age appropriate shows for 6 and under.

All they want to do is suck you dry and take all your money while barely putting in effort to enhance their offerings
Seriously the family account you need to be in the same internet?? This so unnecessary how about someone who is using data? Bfr this is not family friendly at all
"Netflix is a very good ap, the show s and movies are very funny, Netflix has anything you want 2 watch!"
I love this app
GG
Something wrong with the app recently. My Internet is fine but it just keeps getting stuck at loading screen
"Yesterday I made a payment subscription for Netflix but still its saying my acc was on hold and I tried to update my payment method since yesterday, and I kept on trying. Even till now it's showing the same error Something went wrong please try again later . Dude you just spoiled my whole gang mood for the party !! And even after payment it's not even coming... It's sucks"
Very poor ü§¨ü§¨
Nice app.
Love thia app please continue entertaing me with all the best and up to date shows.
Great
I have not been able to get into my account for a couple of days now. Its just sticks on the start up page. I uninstalled and reinstalled but the problem is still persisting.
"bye, I've never rated an app this low. it's not worth it"
Great shows
I Love watching movies
Is my therapy...Thank you for everything!!!
If you pay for the service then you own it. We didn't agree to then limiting people using our account outside of the household which therefore nullifies the contract agreed on before purchase. They have no right. Never using Netflix again. They will feel our wrath.

"Wish I could give 0 stars and get back everything I've ever paid this money hungry company. No password sharing the way you are doing it should be illegal. Screw those traveling, those going to school to further education, and screw elders using their children's accounts because they're on a fixed income. You are what's wrong with this world."
lol now we can't share account
I paid my Amount but can't update in application üòí. Third class experience
New rule that you can't share you're account with anyone outside your household which is done by tracking your IP address.
Don't have this app
"Family sharing Cant use it anymore, my sister is in Canada and shes sharing her netflix and im from philippines. Now we cant access it anymore. its just really sad and disapppointing. Whats the point of family sharing."
good app
"Excellent job on the botched password sharing nonsense. Now the account transfer option is a complete sideways nightmare. You guys love screwing the pooch on every level. Hey dum-dums: here's a tip, everyone who was sharing passwords were doing you a favor. That was the only way you had any viewers at all. I hope this is the end of Netflix, the leader in failure."
Not worth it
so many series are not available dubbed on netflix that's why i don't like netflix much but there are more on other OTT platform ...
It's good for entertainment purposes and the best app üíó i loved this app
Netflix is making it's consumers pay for its inability to adapt it's emerging competition and continuously refuses to invest in content that isn't immediately a household success
"Greedy greedy. As one of the highest priced streaming services, we are gladly saying goodbye after years and years of service. Hope it was worth it.."
Ok yes it is netflix
Nicely
Your new update sucks. Only one household can use an account? Even tho its a family account? What's the point? You need to fix this.
You know what you did!
Terrible
All my fav movies are on netfilx
Worest app forever
THE BEST
"Got rod of my Netlfix. Prices are higher and the content isn't worth it. I take my Roku to hotels or when travelling. Now Netflix expects me to pay $8 more for me to watch an account that's already me watching it? ü§£ The only reason I gave two stars is because of Cobra Kai, which I'll just buy when the series comes out and I'll have no reason to ever get Netflix again."
Netflix is pedo friendly and just as greedy as cable companies
Netflix bad
Please add gellery downloading option and all results
Paid for premium membership so i can use multiple users with friends and family but they are locking it to a single location.. lets all give this app 1 star rating.
THIS IS THE BEST STREAMING SERVICE EVER!!!
It takes too much time n sometimes It doesn't downloads on time.
"Wow, they know how to ruin a good thing. Had to cancel after over 12 years of subscribing after the home member changes. Real sad to see it happen this way. All other providers are gonna follow suit, give it time. Looking forward to the rise in piracy!"
Cancelling due to Netflix greed. Forget sharing your Netflix with family members who do not live with you (even though we pay extra for multiple screens?) New rules favour only nuclear families and also ones who don't go on holidays. A no from me
Canceled my account last year as other services provided better viewing options. Checked my email today to see I was charged for subscription renewal I never authorized.
This app have the best movies
Great variety
"With the newest update, families can no longer share their Netflix account. What a stupid move. Won't bother renewing now."
Perfect for me.. totally

"Why is Netflix incorporated just deleting shows for no reason I want to know like a reason why for sho got deleted or removed, and then they just cut shows in half that many, many many people love ü§îü§îü§îü§î"
The quality of content has went down hill over the last several years and now with not being able to share an account with my family because we live at different locations I have no need to use netflix anymore and will not join back up unless the quality of content improves to justify the price increases.
Liked
STUPID UPDATE
"I use Netflix to be able to watch at my home, my work, and my friend's places when I go over. I use my phone, TV, and work computer. You guys suck for charging more for use outside of the home base. I hope you end up like Blockbuster."
Better tenn movies!
Can't share passwords with my family anymore and doesn't really have much for good shows or movies. Wouldn't recommend.
Netflix was made for sharing movies. Welcome to the next paywall.
Great
"Terrible business model as of late, need a lesson in economics. Hope everyone cancels... Change how family plans work, good luck morons"
The word family is what it means not everyone one lives together in 2023 u don't wanna live with your mom we live in same state and town . canceled because of that stupid password sharing policy
"Est√£o de palha√ßada com esses ""politicas"" novas."
Excellent application super mind blowing experience
"I'm part of the original household. I'm at a hospital now with health problems and I used to be able to watch Netflix. But since Netflix changed their sharing policy, I am no longer able to watch Netflix!! It won't let me. I thought that original household members could watch it, even when they are not home. What happened? Why can't I watch anymore?"
Great selection and AD FREE
I lOv3 this app
It was simple.
Awful and bad. Need I say more? üòé
Newly implemented discrimination against single parents and special needs children. Newly My daughter spends her time in multiple places. Now Netflix won't let her use our account unless she's only an our house. What's the answer Netflix? Are you only good enough or neurotypical children coming from nuclear families? Grandma adult sisters myself and friends yet if she's having a meltdown she's not important enough to you.
Disappointed! Not all families live in the same household. This is just so inconvenient for us who wanna watch while traveling or in another place. At this point you just want to be a signal connection like TV's üëé
Ads before amd after a movie or show i can deal with but during? Netflix can eat my shorts. Bring the 9.99 back you greedy cowards.
Bye.
It doesn't have the latest movies and shows and costs alot
"You seriously think we will be buying a new account just because you locked out our family account to a specific household, NO, you will be losing a customer more likely. What's the point of selling a family account when it's unshareable??? greedy mfs."
This is supper good app
"Delete! Delete!They keep raising the prices with minimun new shows and now they deleted my other accounts that were used on multiple devices in the same household. Ive never, ever share my passcodes with anyone outside my household and now all the shows, that account has watched has been erased. Never thought about canceling this service until now. This war on customers will back fire. Now my kid account got deleted because she has 3 different devices you guys are pathetic and greedy."
Nice job
Awesome
Give us an HDR *OFF* BUTTON. The hdr looks awful on Samsung Amoled devices.
Waaaaay too expensive for what it is.
"They make you pay still and now they play ads, making you pay even more money to see the same thing without ads!"
"When a company gets barmy managemet, it is immediately seen on their products! First asking to confirm the device and when I do not want to do this, the quality gets immediately bad. After the update is even worst - I cannot even start my account! The app managed even to hang completely my tablet couple of times! Actually after the update never managed to start properly and crashes all the time. Even one star is too much!"
Corporate greed
"Stop asking me if I'm still watching. Who do you think you are, Netflix?"
I'm able to watch my favorite shows on Netflix
Since latest updates i can no longer get this working on my daughters Samsung galaxy A7 tab (Was previously working fine) Ive tried all of suggested fixes but none work and now playstore Just says netflix is no longer compatible with device and to contact developers Device is certified and running latest Android version
Well i advice you to download it in case youtube fails i watch many movies i love it üíìüíìüíìüíì
I can't delete this app from my phone
Sucks app!!
10 ads per film
Please improve the logo quality
Very happy üòä with this app
"Excellent,far above cra"
Since the last update it keeps buffering. Kindly do something about it. I have been facing this problem this year. This is the second that it's happening. The first time I faced this problem was at the beginning of this year and it lasted for more than a month.
You have debited my account and I do not have access. This sucks can you refund me
It never opens only home sreen is available
No More Password Sharing: BYE BYE
Rubbish - I dont want the app.
It was enjoyble
"New update version is ridiculous it defeats the whole point of ""family acc"""
Too bad I can't download it on my phone It keeps saying can't install nd I don't know why
Can't watch a man called otto because I don't have the right plan. Gross. Gotta watch ads though
good streaming service.
Money hungry
concorrentes tem custo benef√≠cio muito melhor
High class contents
Netflix made me quit pirating back in the day but if you gonna bust my balls and not allow my mother who lives the house next to mine on my own property to enjoy her soap opera then i guess I'm ready to teach her how to ride the waves and to return to the waves myself this is the new pirate Era
It great and my girlfriend loves it
Nice app
Love Netflix
i love everything
good apart from the fact it deletes the best shows to make room for really bad ones
Nice....
Ÿäÿß ÿ≤ŸäŸÜ ÿßÿ®ŸÑ ÿ®ÿ≥
came back after a few months. Nothing new to view. Netflix is one LOTTA SHITE
"Not worth the extra money anymore. I share my account with my family and now that I cannot do that there is no point to it anymore. They lost most of their catalogue and replaced it with poorly made originals. The only thing i watched on it in the past few months was Drive to Survive, but one show does not justify a streaming service. At this point a minute or 2 of ads on hulu is better than 30 dollars a month extra. I will continue to use the other services that my family shares with me."
Credible
Not worth
Without primium no open app
It's weird to think 20 years as a customer will soon end permanently.. The moment we see a $8 added payment the cancelation will go through. We gave blockbuster up years ago for movies shipped by mail. Now everything has changed so much you are one of many. And not even close to the best yet you have the arrogance of a top tear service. The end maybe near for Blockbuster 2.0 if this decision goes forward
So good
Netflix household..wut...
"There is nothing worth to see here. The users should be payed for their time using thus applications. Also, it cannot easily be uninstalled from Samsung android systems."

"With the new policy changes, I can no longer access my masterbed room Netflixs. My daughter can't access Netflixs in her room either now. We are not password sharing. We have 2 IP addresses due to poor internet quality in our area. I have also lost access to my phone, my daughter's phone, my daughter's laptop, and my laptop when out. I called customer service and was told oh well!!!! Really, we will be another leaving customer. We pay for the maximum screens. Can't answer split custody"

Can't even use it at school without it questioning if I pay for the service.
Netflix rocks
Stop Netflix
Great.
"The had their golden era. Now it's time to NOT consent those ridiculous decisions they're making. F U, Netflix, F U for ever. Hope you never recover and dissapear once and for all."
If your thinking about downloading Netflix dont . They charge so much money for limited amount of users and price goes up more the users at the same time watch out dont have everyone watching at the same time itll kick you off and for the same shows and movies that are on there every month I dont think the price is worth it I will be unsubscribing and uninstalling to make room for other streaming apps that show the same shows at a cheaper price

Used to be great till the money grab
"I used to love Netflix. Now, after I got the Netflix household notice for the millionth time on my parent's TV - which utterly spoiled movie nights - I am seriously considering discontinuing it. The offer isn't significantly different from Disney+, and originals are hardly anything to write home about. For those who may be monitoring CSAT at Netflix: have someone other than the geniuses behind this move monitor the impact of this change. I seriously doubt it'll bring you the RoI they advertised"

I love Netflix and I wish I didn't have to cancel but I do not love the password sharing ban and I will start using Netflix once they lift that ban. Until that happens I will not use it.
"Used to use this daily around the house. Today I tried to cast from my phone to my office TV only to be told that Netflix is not for sharing outside my household, and now I can't cast to that screen. If I wanted to be limited to using the service at my home address, I'd get a Sky subscription. Will not be resubbing at the end of the month."
Deformation and falsification of historical documentaries such as pharaohs and Vikings.
Cause it is amazing
"-----5 suggestion --- 1) upload more content 2)dubb the content in all languages specially in Hindi (and English), all means all every content should be dubbed 3) upload more show , we watch movie like everywhere we need shows . 4) national and international content in my language that is Hindi 5) plz search good content for show , means apart from Netflix many online content company is uploading more , fantastic content . I like Netflix but last 6 months r like hell no content"

The app don't have any tamil dubbed version but having the hindi audio.why?we are also subscribed.But i have saw the tamil dubbed version of the same movie in other websites.simply NETFLIX is a waste of money for all tamil people and I consider this as you guys don't respect our language
It is not playing
Not use full
Paid since its launch but no more. Don't think I can't find a Netflix exclusive somewhere else.
The added household feature is going to be a headache when my family isn't currently at home and want to access Netflix. Corporate Greed.
"it is a great way to watch a film and especially after they added Harry Potter back on there, I have used this app a lot!"
Your customer service sucks. I don't have access to the email used to create my account. I will not pay 19.99 for a service I can't access!!

I have facing the problem while using the netflix as it is not opening in my phone . It gets stuck after displaying the logo and doesn't work forward . I have tried to reinstall it several times but it's not working still . I would request to please fix this problem asap as my plan is getting wasted and I am not being able to watch the shows.
Q sweeE aww
Refuse to pay writers a living wage (sometimes refusing to pay them at all!) But want to charge me to use the accounts in already paying for?! Maybe if you made good shows or didn't cancel everything the shareholders would be happier......

"I don't recommend wasting your life watching films and series anyway +the inappropriate scenes,it damages your brain and life and leads to depression in the end you better have a clean life"
unethical pricing
Nice one
"As a loyal Netflix customer who previously enjoyed streaming on my Samsung phone, I am disappointed that the newest model is not compatible with the highest quality streaming available on your platform. It is unacceptable that a cutting-edge phone in 2021 cannot support HD streaming on the Netflix app. I hope that Netflix can work with Samsung to find a solution to this issue so that users of the Samsung S23 Ultra can enjoy full HD streaming on Netflix like other devices."
This app is not downloading
"I love how at first you were all like. Love is sharing your password! Now you're penalizing individuals. Your corporation is greedy and your service, especially forbthe price is LACK LUSTER! Oh, and raise my monthly cost one more time and I'm canceling. Max is better."
Not the very best.
"You know we can cancel the premium part ,there's plenty of other apps , most of the movies you show i already owned digital copies.. peacock and paramount have better shows than y'all"

Just such a glichy streaming app. You close it once and you have to reconnect to it unlike any other streaming app. It's pathetic
Nice app
Thank you for the woke content.
Ok
4 screen subscription but I can't use 4 screens because of the ridiculous screen sharing rules. You can't cast to TVs either. Traveling with Netflix is impossible. This app is pointless. I cancelled my subscription after being a loyal customer for over a decade. Absolutely tone deaf and greedy decision making that ended the company for good.
"Disappointing that a platform that has been out so long is now having video issues after the last update. Been having an issue of green lines across the top of the screen and a green fade showing up on the left side on my screen (galaxy S10) and my girlfriends (pixel 6 pro) phones and our laptops. I don't see how a company that has done so well can make this mistake and not correct it immediately, this has been an ongoing issue for 3 weeks now. Honestly has us about to shutdown our accounts."
ARE YOU STILL WATCHING NETFLIX??????????????
I hope Netflix goes bankrupt for being so greedy. They will never get another dime from me and I hope this is something more people do.
"I'm not sure how to put this. If you know viewership drops off, why not close out the plot sooner. Awesome, otherwise."
I heard about the password sharing policy changes online and hoped it would never come. A friend of mine who has his own account drives a truck and was out of town and it charged him an extra $8 on top of his subscription he already pays. Cancelled my subscription and he cancelled his. Me and my spouse are long distance most of the time and if it's going to cost twice the amount of money while we travel to watch shows together then this app has no value to me.
Can't watch vertically/portrait on my cellphone.
Como es posible que ofrezcan solamente calidad 720p para el plan basico? Youtube siendo gratuito ofrece mejores cosas. Que decepci√≥n.
Easy to register & use
Poor content qualty
"Netflix increased prices for fewer services and gouged loyal members. Content is meh. Upgraded to 4 screens so my family could watch at the same time in our houses. You want us to pay extra for the same 5 person family (including kids) to use the same service while in each of our own homes? I will downgrade to the $7 plan, pay for a single extra member slot for another house, which would leave me paying $15 /mo instead of my current $20. FAIL. Do better Netflix. Some families are separated."
"I buy Netflix to share with my young adult children. We pay the max amount for that reason! I can share my health insurance but not my video stream service? No thanks, I'll cancel and look up other alternatives. The part that upsets us all is that my kids lose their saves and lists. There is no option for them to break away and keep their preferences and pay for their own service. Why would you force this without more options for separating? The only option is to lose all of us as customers."
Mm
Price is not worth it
Lets stall
"Household on same wifi? If I could rate less than one star I would. Kid is away at college but they need to pay for their own account. Screw that. Netflix, you just signed your own death letter. Bye bye."
Making a poor business decision after continously charging more money. Hope a competitor makes you go bankrupt
Like it
This app is so good my only problem is nothing
fix the password sharing. we already pay to have more than one user on the why does it matter what house they are in.
"Without subscription you not allowed to seen this app content list, it's too much bad rule."
"Better subtitles please. I was watching the anime ""A silent voice"" if the characters don't voiced out their hand jutsu sign language, it's hard to interpret sometimes. I understand the contexts but some are vague for me. If the production company intended that then it's fine, but if we actually have the translation, please show them or add an option to show them. Pc phone tablet"
I love it
cool
Good
Have my subscription for over 10 year. I'm finally saying goodbye. I'm basically just paying and waiting for months and years for shows that can only be streamed in other regions. I don't recommend this app for people outside specific regions.
Gays
Netflix is a great app to watch trending shows and movies!! You should try to watch stranger things!
Charges me because my mom uses my netflix account. I guess it was good for a while but there's no real reason to have it anymore. Hulu or prime are much better.
Netflix it's really helpful instead of buying movies
"Agora nos abriga a assistir comerciais, cada vez pior !!!"
It used to be a great service! Now they are crooks!
"It sucks when the megacorp decides to screw over folks with low income who travel for a living and cannot sign into the ""home network"" while on the road. It's disappointing."
Took away multiple screen functionality that I have been paying for for years. Try Hulu/Disney+/Prime Video/any of the hundreds of other streaming services instead
There are some promblems netflix like whenever I try to put in my phone number on a new netflix account it says something went wrong please try again later and when I try again later it deosent work
It keeps glitching everytime I watch something
Don't make us pay for extra accounts.

Netflix's greed is pathetic. The latest clamp down on password sharing when that's literally how they promoted themselves is despicable.
Stop the African soap operas
Great üëç
New policy is horrible. I use my account when I travel and during lunch breaks in my office at times. I refuse to keep paying extra after I already payed for more users on my account to suffice for the other devices. I'm switching to other platforms unless this policy is revoked.

"Just another corporate company. I've been the bill payer for my family for years and now that everyone has moved away, we can no longer look at at what we've each been watching and share recommendations. The recent price hikes made it hard to justify paying for this when there is a cost of living crisis. This decision by netflix is the nail in the coffin for me. Goodbye, you used to be great."
No share no netflix

Useful app
"If you travel at all to spend time with your family, dont bother with this streaming service. Or if you use a VPN. They want you to pay and extra 8 Bucks a month if you watch content from a differ IP address. PER IP, ffs guys."
"Literally every other streaming service allows password sharing, but why doesn't the most expensive one with the worst libary allow it anymore? Netflix used to have a huge libary and allow password sharing, but now there libary keeps on shrinking and they no longer allow password sharing. 4k netflix is $20 a month, which is ridiculous. It used to be $8 a month for the most expensive plan. Use any other streaming service but Netflix, please."
Great movies to enjoy
Wow
Amazing and amazing just amazing
"Very money hungry, can't password share to my family that is less fortunate. See ya later Netflix. I hope your pockets are full and it was worth it. You are no better than Comcast."

"Greedy bastards. Used to be 5 star, now we are at 1 and likely going go cancel. I have 2 residences (physically mine) TWO people use the account, myself & partner - we don't ""share"" our passwords w/ others, but now we are being punished for having a dual residence? Been customers since the beginning. Netflix, we stood by you when you went from $8 to $23 a month. I won't stand by for this. You're not nickel & diming my family to death. Way to discriminate against dual families. Hulu here we come"
Amazing experience in India but we want marvel (MCU) and another American tv shows

"Removed password sharing. Dumb choice, especially for our deployed troops."

It's nice
OP opopopop
Unsubscribed and uninstalled. The new password sharing rules have turned my family off from this company. The few shows I like on this app kept me on but Netflix needs a wakeup call.
The lowest screen brightness setting is still too bright. I hope there'd be even lower options soon.
"5 5t5554 4. Reread 4. I,,, have have"
Canceled account due to poor decision to not let people get what they pay for.
CANCELLED!! $31.6 billion profit and you want more!! I let my son use my Netflix account at his dad's house because his dad is a terrible person and would never be able to afford such things. The fact that he can no longer use my netflix account in another home is ridiculous. It's just the 2 of us! I'm not paying another $8 on top of an HD price for my son to use Netflix! It's just the 2 of us! You guys are crazy if you think people are gonna be OK with this. Billions in profit!!!!
I like it it has pretty good movies
Terrible services stream.. no wonder why Netflix is losing so much money right now.
Well I've always had a five-star review on Netflix because they were really good but was the new feature they have where you cannot share your password with anyone outside of your household I'm going to have to give it a one-star because this is ridiculous every other platform lets you share your password but since Netflix doesn't get enough money they have to make it so you can't it's ridiculous and it's bs this is not even right they're lucky they still have subscribers because of this

I love this app. This app have all kinds of anime and us and Asian web series. I would seriously like to give it a 5 star . But this app lacks some things. I would like to appeal to add a review button so we can review any movie or show and also give it a rating Out of 5 . All the way the app is best.

"Goodbye, netflix! I have been a user since it first came out in my country, and I am disappointed to see all the incompetent decisions you have made over the last couple of years. How I share/use something THAT I AM PAYING FOR is for me, and only me, to decide. What's next? Are you gonna make us pay for the number of devices we use to watch netflix? I just uninstalled the app. I am not gonna give netflix any more money for them to make these decisions and spend it all on mediocre shows."

Ive been subscribed since day one. Now I cant even share my password with family even tho we are separated due to a them having cancer and being isolated in the hospital. Its really a shame Netflix doesn't give a **** about their customers. Canceled and Uninstalled.

Price gouging. 22 a month for one tv on 4k is outrageous.

App is just fine. I just can't really justify netlfix recent business decisions and price hikes with term changes. Giving a bad review and canceling my subscription are the only options to demonstrate that
Netflix was mediocre for a while and now it's annoying
I love netflix but since they are now making each household have their own account or pay extra for other houses we will be deleting our account. Great job netflix. Customers for years down to no more
Very good app
"I mean, it's Netflix. App sized. Fairly easy to use. I dig it. Enjoy. Five stars."

"Que decepci√≥n , entonces seg√∫n Netflix no podremos usar nuestras cuentas fuera de nuestro hogar, entonces que sentido tiene tener esta aplicaci√≥n en nuestros celulares o PC si solo las podremos usar en un solo pa√≠s, viajeros excluidos para el uso de la aplicaci√≥n. Felicitaciones a las empresas que venden servicios de tv en Colombia sus suscripci√≥n estar√°n a punto de subir."
These people think they have the right to dictate how consumers use their accounts. Forcing people to pay an extra surcharge for something that is their basic consumer right is a form of extortion. I stopped paying for Netflix ages ago and have recently uninstall the app completely. This has turned into a literal scam.
"Best exsperamant,"
"Canceling, so much for love is sharing a password. I'm not paying extra just so my kids can watch away from home."
Good variety of options
"""Ceo pay goes from $28.1 million in 2022 to up to $34.65 million in 2023"" I think I know what's going on here. Do you? Hope you plan on paying your writers fairly with the extra cash. But judging by the on going writer strike, doesn't look that way."
"My experience with Netflix has been absolutely wonderful. From the TV shows to the movies, everything about Netflix has been great. I've laughed, cried and laughed again and I've also been very inspired. Thank you so much ü•∞ü•∞üíöüíö"
"Netflix has seriously gone downhill. Shows and movies aren't great, price is going up but the shows and movies aren't worth it, and they're limiting account access which means me, a college student still apart of my parents household won't be able to access it even though I'm still in the household. Netflix is not worth it."
I'll give my 5star rating if enable TV cast. Prime Video has such feature and I can transfer the video easily to my Android TV.
Bon
Corporate greed hits again. Going to be downgrading subscription to the bare minimal.
#ditchnetflix New account sharing rules are dumb. My family is low income. We were already paying $19.99 for 4 simultaneously streams and that was expensive. There's no way in hell I'm paying $7.99 x2 for my mom and aunt. Get over yourself Netflix. There's good programming else where far cheaper and a lot for free.
You know why
"I was a Netflix subscriber for over a decade. This ""no password sharing"" ""only household members can watch"" bs will be the hill Netflix decides to die on."
Do I have to really say anything at this point. Greed.
Netfix is dead I have uninstalled Netflix from all my devices and I hope everyone does the same taking advantage of us like that bs
The new app is just terrible at presenting me with things to watch.
!!!(SCAM ALERT)!!! DO NOT DOWNLOAD!!!NEW NETFLIX RULE MAKES YOU HAVE A SEPERATE ACCOUNT TO WATCH ON YOUR MOBILE DEVICE IF YOU ARE AWAY FROM YOUR HOME WIFI!!!!
Bad
Very nice
it is my favrite app beause it has my favrite moive
New PW thing sux
its nice app
Yes this is amazing
garbage content and the new netflix household thing is annoying. if i'm paying $20 a month i should be able to choose whoever i want to use my account. netflix is so sleazy.
"if you add the Puerto Rico tax you will know that you'll lose 99% if not 100% of you're membership better keep it on $19.99 or you'll know what will occur, now a new sharing policy you guys keep screwing around so again I cancel the susbcription"
"New policy makes it nearly impossible for people who travel heavily for work/education to share an account with their family. Because of my partners field of work, we have to cancel as we would need two accounts because they are not always home to connect to our wifi."
"greedy company, bad app"
Excellent
Used to be great. Now the content continues to get worse and worse while the price gets higher and higher. Cancelled
"Netflix sold out and Is going to lose most of their viewers with this single household sharing BS. I pay for my family, and have been sharing with my kids. They have moved out, but they don't make enough money to pay for their own subscription. I'm going to cancel the subscription and get something else I can share with them."
I'd like to cancel my netflix thank you

"Once I'm done finishing the series that I am on, I'm canceling my subscription. People should be able to share accounts with whoever they want, how can you be so greedy??

"Tenho duas casas, vou precisar pagar + R$12,90 pra continuar utilizando minha conta nas duas resid√™ncias. UM ABSURDO!!"
Wow. R.I.P. Netflix. Greed will get ya everytime. We (the consumer) tried to tell yall. Smgdh and giggling
Please make it available to have multiple profile on one account back!!!
"My family already pays extra (Premium Plan), the fact that we have to pay extra PER person/different address/WiFi is honestly a joke. Having an extra member should've just been included in the premium so people would just have to upgrade not add almost a whole $10 PER PERSON?! Disappointed Netflix, just like everything else all yalls care about it money, what shocker."
"So, in order to have netflix at my house and my vacation home i have to pay twice now? Hard pass on that one Ill pirate every show i need to watch thats on Netflix. Yall think you're going to save money by keeping Netflix to 1 household but you're wrong. You greedy bastards are gonna lose money. I hope netflix stock plummets and it becomes no more"
"the most idiotic move. There are hundreds of streaming sites, the point behind netflix is watch anywhere. I cant watch MY NETFLIX in the hospital. You regularly raise the price &now we cant watch what we pay for as it was marketed to us. You bankrupted yourself.Peacock, prime, hulu I get hulu 1.99 can watch anywhere, vudu, every channel has an app, comcast, apple tv, etc etc list goes on. Seriously whoever put this rule in place just destroyed Netflix. We were barely tolerating you & your price"
It's great but I would love for more movies to be able to be on there
"Sick and tired of the netflix game, of getting the voiceovers and text to read the same. And when the play it the next year they call it New. Only worth $10 a month AT Best."
It's great
I love the app
Stop the household sharing nonsense
"Dear Netflix, since you want to add money on my bill for using my account in multiple locations. Can you unblock all your contents? Like If it's on Netflix somewhere in the world then it should be available everywhere in the world"
Removed password sharing
just flashes and won't stop!
Disappointed about another company carrying about money more than people..
I think Netflix should give a choice to manually stop or cancel automatic sub plans without cancelling one's membership.
"My mom already paid double the price for extra devices for us to share her account. If you are going to make sure no one can share accounts, the least you can do is remove the added cost for multiple devices streaming at once within the same household."
I can't sign up I don't know why I did pay the for a month but it doesn't work on my phone
Why are there so many 3rd rate/party apps baked into the operating system? Why can't I delete this app? It has nothing to do with anything.
"They are charging the same price as everyone else but not allowing you to share your netflix, affecting divorced parents and kids going off to college (just to name a couple)."
I severally tried to purchased subscription but it didn't work it show error on my g pay upi's id That make suck!
You can watch any movie or anything.It has good quality.
"Unfortunately I'm getting tired of this rainbow selection content, netflix became a very strange place not for a regular family oriented user..! Additionally I hope it will go bankrupt after new restrictions!"
Bad
Sharing is caring.
First class.
"Terrible this update is just one more reason to not use netflix anymore. Already have a ton of other streaming services, what's the point??"
Stop working on samsung tablet device
Netflix sucks.
Internation house of pancakes is a top destination from 1999 to visit before the merger of universe B117 and C157 . The air is much cleaner here besides the fact that B117 got caught up in an interstellar ice cloud formation and turned to suparubactic melanoma.
1 star for cancelling the winx saga!.
Cast button always takes hours to appear on the app ..so frustrating. This is so not done .Pay and then suffer . Thank Netflix
"Ever since they stopped password sharing, my entire family can't use the app anymore. Garbage company that is money hungry. 0/10, don't use Netflix."
Netflix getting rid of password sharing is the worst mistake. I will never pay for this greedy corporation.
Why's it that after signing up it shows me nothing again
P√©sima la nueva pol√≠tica.
"The content isn't as good as it used to be and now they're charging way too much. My last straw was the new fee for accounts used outside the home, so now I can't share with my family in college unless I pay even more money."
You guys need to stop making cellphones a requirement to sign up for services. My grandma and a lot of older people she knows don't have cellphones. And working around that is a b!^ch
"Easy to use. Fun. Also one complaint though, they don't usually release content on netflix until a few months later, for example, they added IT 3 or 4 yeas after it came out and I had already watched it so yeah andni mean we payed for it after all but 5 out five though, good quality.... If they release stuff just after released that would be amazing! I know because of licenses it can be hard to solve but other than that , keep up the good work!"
"Even though there is not enough indic content in Netflix, we some how try cope with the content but there are huge pains when using Netflix, the biggest is. When you try to watch a movie which is originally Tamil but if I want to watch it in Telugu I again need to search for it in Telugu and then play it üôÅ, broo then why are you even keeping the language and audio settings ü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è. And you find the Tamil movie in telugu language section RIP Netflix sorting algorithms."
i love netflix. <- that was from years ago. After the new household update I no longer do. College sucks when u can no longer access ur shows and your parents can't keep getting priced up because of this new rule.
I just like the app has got more and important staff than the previous one
Too bad I couldn't use it
It's just not worth it anymore
Incredibly goof
Promotes nudity violence
Password sharing crack down is ridiculous.
Servicio de streaming con propaganda?
"Greedy people, low quality selection, new rules suck, just not worth it anymore."
"excellent, hasstle free, and very easy to use thank you guys"
I like it
Terrible updates. Why would you take away the one thing that tied Netflix all together? Why should my family have to pay for multiple screens when they can't use it because they don't live in the same household. If you're going to do that you should at least lower the prices to be able to make it more affordable. Terrible terrible choices and we the consumers told you so.
netflix is going downhill especially with the password sharing crackdown . netflix used to be good but now a days there are better platforms to watch what netflix has
"Used my family's account while in Uni and can't anymore because of the 'crackdown'. They pay for the extra screen but would now have to pay even more to use it outside of their house. Pretty useless. So now they're going to cancel the extra screen because they don't need it, and will probably cancel themselves as they rarely use it anyway and only kept it for us. Very clever business decision! Back to the high seas and the likes of Plex."
Terrible app now.
Control freaks they control how many people and where you watch.
Not paying for each screen and no one I honestly know is...THIS IS A PROTEST I NEVER PAID AND I STILL CALL BS.
Love it
This app is very very good and exceptional
I have to pay for two accounts because I have two wifis. Might resubscribe when they remove the account sharing change but it's been a LONG time since Netflix had anything worth watching anyways.
"it changed into a foreign language, now I can't use it because its not in English"
The account sharing rule coming out? Yeah bye Netflix.
"Workaround! Just click ""not now"" for the home setup. Then if you never declare a home tv you dont have to worry about not being able to share your password with your family."
Good
"Used to be really good now, there are no shows, takes forever to buffer and too expensive"
"Consistent price increases for a membership, while simultaneously removing content and canceling shows. Now I'm being asking to pay more for my family who use my account that live across the country. They have been using my account for years with no issues and now there's a problem that I can conviently buy the answer to. Extremely disappointing and I'm very dissatisfied with the direction the company is moving towards"
Nice üëçüèª
They now charge for users in the same account... even if you are already paying the family plan...
It stunk no emails to inbox'es

Netflix is not successful in India becouse they won't give best series in Hindi language
Introducing a bs pw sharing policy
The app is good but most of their series they only post season 1 only or 2 instead of full series so one is left hanging without the rest of the series
"annoying app, just updated it and i can't even watch a single thing as it is not loading anything just a dark screen, wasted my money on the subscription üòë üò§"
Nice site. Wish u could bring Son's of anarchy
Claptrap is wite
"Netflix making people pay extra to use the subscription they pay for monthly to use it outside of their house. Like during travel, vacations or work events. We canceled netflix and moved to hulu."
Streaming or downloading quality not better'
So Many interesting movies And Tv show s.
"Love this app, haven't had any problems with it at all"
Not worth it anymore. Bye
Never usd it. Howw can I delete netflix?
Gotta love Netflix
OK
"A few crashes I could handle, but now with password sharing gone, so am I"
"Netflix was okay, but now when I downloads episodes of movies it is downloaded and I can bearly watch or hear what is being said. It is very bad, I do not know for how long I wil try to solve it before I cancel my contract and not fi Netflix sny more, I never had this problem and it is the last 2 months now and I am getting very frustrated with this sh..t!!!!"
It's the best
Thank you for allowing us to download shows and movies!!!!!
Good
"EDIT ***************************************** Neflix feel that they are losing subscribers due to sharing.... the real problem isnt that the real problem is you are posting to many inappropriate things on the kids area. Cuties is one of them so i remove my kids from watching there. There is hulu, paramount+, amazon prime, peacock, HBO max, disney+.... so much are out there ill just cancel this netflix this is the final straw. KIDS ARE WATCHING THINGS ON NETFLIX NOT SUITABLE. PARENTS WATCH THEM"
Really like Netflix . You have your choice of what you like
Team umizoomi
my netflix was working fine still work on my computer but stop working on my smart tv netflix only load 25% and hangs up
1. Netflix is misleading audience on the content by using images on cover not part of the actual show. There is photo of Virupaksha indian temple on the show ancient apocalypse when there is no photo video or reference of the temple or any indian temple in the show. It is a cheap tactic to get clicks from indian audience when there is no indian content on the show. 2. They do not accept all credit card payments. It takes multiple attempts to pay even with cards mentioned on their website.
"Netflix used to be the thing now they suck, with all the gaay show they put up, yall should remame to Gayflix"
Word coming out when full screen
Time to cancel netflix..
Useless...so much rules and everything prime video is better than Netflix

"I love this. Perfect for a night in! Lovely to watch with family well recommended. I love Netflix, it's a go-to movie and series app! One thing I don't like is that a few series and movies go after it sometimes, other than that it's so good!"

Outrageous price for content that will be cancelled as quickly as it can be.
Now I am passed from school and Netflix is my partner in the epic time pass ü•≥ü•≥
Household update sucks. About to lose a lot more people due to not being able to share!
Forced to have this useless app on my phone so I decided to give it a 1 star review. Honestly hope this company goes bankrupt soon.
"Due to the new household feature, I can no longer use my family account while off at college, and as a college student, I can obviously not afford frivolous purchases such as my own account. The service was already on the downfall, and I hope the company falls apart. They had the right idea years ago, and threw it all away for greed like the imbeciles they are. Good riddance."
Nice app
"When I try to watch a movie on my iPad, it says the title isn't available or in the middle of watching it, it says that it isn't available. There's no issue when I play the same movie on my phone, so it doesn't make sense that it's available on one device and not on the other."
"Shame on Netflix for taking away password sharing. This is how companies go out of business, by taking away features that people liked about the company."
"Quality app, never any issues or bugs, works perfectly."
More forced spy/bloat ware I cannot uninstall.
Changing from 5 stars to 1. You ruined Netflix
"Sharing is caring! Once upon a time Netflix encouraged us to share accounts and now they don't like that. I've always rooted for this company but now I hope it joins Blockbusters. So long Netflix and hello Hulu, Disney+, hell even Paramount."
Great
Superb
Excellent
It cost money like alot
"Pathetic how you think customers don't have multiple homes. The young adult who bounces from mom and dad has one account with two different internet servers and now they can only use one? What about the person who travels for work and has one east coat home and one west coats home with two different internet services? The way you are trying to ""account control"" with devices limits and ""server limits"" is theft the other way. You sold a stream now let whoever - however use what they purchased"
"Fix your app pls, every time I go to News & hot my Netflix glitches"
"Was the best streaming app a few years ago(had a family subscription for years), degraded year over year, now whatching a burning garbage pile is whay more fun than Netflix..."

I love this netflix
Nice
"App is fine, but you guys keep taking off the best shows"
"Already paying premium for 4k plan, you got even greedier and want an extra because I don't live with my parents, you lost a 10 years subscriber today, hope you get cancelled."
Fine it difficult downloading movie sometimes
Worst app ever App not opening Stucked at netflix
"It causes my TV's to freeze, or glitch's out so you can hear it but there's nothing on the screen. Plus they can get bent if I can't even share with my kids, canceled."
If it wasnt free with T-Mobile I would just drop it. Now their war on password sharing is a new low even for them. I travel a lot (over half the year) and some how they can tell which locations are actually me? Charge me any extra and watch my subscription vanish. I really hope this event will become another market crasher for Netflix.
Greedy company
"""nEtFlIx AcCoUnTs ArE fOr OnE HoUsEhOlD"" you clearly don't understand your position on the market, you are the last option we look to stream content. Max, Hulu, Peacock, Paramount plus, and Prime are all better options not trying to penny grab like your greedy company. It's sad to see one of the original streaming services to be so out of touch with their users. There's enough content out there to never need you again, you're done"
"Great Netflix are showing a lot of new Movies, Documentaries, & Medical oriented shows."
"+ ADDITIONAL 7.99 for sharing an account, I will be canceling my membership."
simple to use good app
"This "" household only "" password stuff is straight up stupid.If you're gonna raise the price of my subscription 3 times within a year.I should have full access to my account no matter what I'm logged in on.Now there's a chance I'll get charged even more if i happen to travel a little bit more than usual??these people do not make smart business decisions...."
"Not worth it, unless you wanna watch one thing that will get taken off within the month you watch it."
"Why do you feel the need to suck as much money as possible out of your users while actively destroying the amount of people who want to use your service? I share an account with my family and use Netflix very often when it comes to travelling and visiting other relatives in other countries. But now that you are locking Netflix down to a '1 household per account"" requirement, we're going to have to cancel and pick another streaming service. Well done Netflix"
Good
Completely pointless now. I used to use it while I travel around and now I can't. Think I'll stick with other streaming services from now on.

Disgusting practices to ban password sharing.

"Goodbye Netflix! $20 a month, and now my broke mother can't watch it either. Blockbuster didn't care how many people watched something as long as you returned the movie!! Peacock and Paramount+ are going to overtake Netflix. I'm already fed up with all of the voice-over movies. Just give me the actual voices with subtitles because those voice actors have no acting skills."
I love anime
Ol
Thanks for the `extra member` update. Now I can't use my own account if I travel and connect to another internet :) The price for the premium version is already the most expensive from the entire movie streaming platforms. You've just lost another user.
"App not working properly for past 10 days I,the intro screen is stuck ie only Netflix banner is seen ,and not loading after that. Because of this I unsubscribed from 500 rupees plan .I need refund cause not able to use the app properly"

Sharing is what made Netflix so popular and they took it away
Nice movie app
It's annoying having to reconfirm all my devices just because Netflix is butthurt about password sharing.
Great
I've used Netflix since 7.99 days through the pay increase to 17.11 considering unsubscribing over the years but never did. However the new rule just doesn't work for me. I am a travel nurse and I am away from home for MONTHS at a time which would cause me to be charged an additional 7.99 per month. It's a major no for me!
Gotta complement how enthusiastic Netflix is to off themselves.

"Perfect streaming service if you want to be harassed for using the streaming service on devices outside of your home network, even when it is a household member using them, very inconvenient when you share custody of a child and they want to watch your plan on the co-parents network. Over priced service plans and very slow at releasing quality entertainment."

"Netflix has become the worst app ever on Android. App keep crashing left right center. Tried every darn thing. Uninstalled and reinstalled. Deleted cache, Delete Data, Shutdown my phone, restarted. Updated my phone software. I use Samsung Galaxy S10 Lite. 8 GB Ram and 512 GB internal storage with space more than 315 GB available. Virtual memory of Ram extended for paging to 24 GB delete cache of every other app on my phone apart from Netflix. Nothing works. I'm about to cancel my subscription."
Bad
Bad movies criticism and hate toward minorities
Uninstalled for this reasons 1- The Cleopatra documentary is a proof that Netflix lies in the documentaries 2- Netflix is planting bad ideas in our children like pornography and encouraging them to be gay üò°
"The company has fallen. They are as trash as Verizon, Time Warner, Google, and other greed based delusional organizations. Selling out to the Walstreet infinite growth boom bust cycle. Now they are on the Bust phase. The only thing they had was being on citizens side in conflicts (Net Neutrality) and no ads. The trash executives broke that. The app fails because of their anti-consumer policies. So disappointed to see another company ruined by investors GREED."
"The fact that they have now switched their business model to stop people sharing accounts make them just like every other greedy streamer. The whole point of Netflix was to try and bypass the strangehold TV networks had, and to be innovative in the way they delivered content. Now, they're just like them. Let's all jump ship."
I have to pay for every screen I use netflix on and an extra fee for a separate household now!! Huge scam!!

"Netflix, once hailed as the pioneer of streaming services, seems to have taken a significant step backward with its recent changes. As a long-time subscriber, I can't help but express my disappointment with the platform's decision to mimic the limitations and frustrations of traditional cable TV. Gone are the days of limitless streaming options and the freedom to watch content whenever and wherever we pleased. Netflix's regression to a model reminiscent of cable TV, where we are forced to pay"

Very bad no share
"I have been using Netflix for over 10yrs nonstop since it was offered at $8. Today, I pay over $21 without havjng said a word... but now you want to prevent me from sharing my account with my sisters like I have for years. It has always been the same 4 people using the account for over 7 years, and now I have to pay extra for each if they don't live in the same house? Enough is enough! Why should I pay over $35?? 10 years=3x increase. We know the $ is going straight to the execs' pockets. üëéüèº"
"Your worthless password sharing stance is why I cancelled, and why everyone else should too. Hope you fail."
"The whole point was to have family watch it even if they moved off to college. But the household thing is sad, and instead of making horrible movies and wasting money on said movies. Just invest in a good movie"
I will be deleting my Netflix account if I have to log in every 30 days
"Hey homeflix, Thanx for changing it back to normal. Idk whose decision it was to make the new and hot section the first thing that you open to, but that person is an idiot."
Can no longer use my family's account because I've moved away from home
"La restricci√≥n de uso de cuentas es absurdo y anti familiar, mientras mi hija ve en su casa yo quiero ver desde la m√≠a y seg√∫n netflix debo pagar m√°s, terrible esas medidas... Todos califiquemos 1 estrella hasta que lo cambien"

"Netflix no longer allows my family to share an account, even though we paid extra for having multiple people using it at once. They're money grabbing trash."
"I have had Netflix for years and I like alot of the shows on it. The new update of needing to pay $8 extra dollars a month to have an ""extra member"" watch is ridiculous. I move between my parents home and an apartment. I can't afford the already high rate and splitting it with my parents made it do able."
My moblie app won't let me change my plan. Please fix.
My whole netfix is filled with k drama although i like it but not this much maximum seriesand movies are not available in india i dont understand if it is not available then what is the usw for even paying netflix for.
Amezing
The app is awesome although it freeze during streaming sometimes and you only hear the audio and I can't seem to upgrade my plan
This crackdown on password sharing is the reason for the one star. Why only sell 4K with 4 streams at once if I can't share it with close friends or family. Does Netflix not already make enough money
I don't like the new my list design go back to the other one looks dumb ona tablet perspective
"10/10 job destroying your business, it'll be fun to see if you still exist in a year."

Keep getting the you're not in the same household screen after the new rule has come in. I'm sorry but my friend is paying for a certain amount of people to use her account I pay some money to her for use of said account. Absolute bullsh!t Netflix. Your service is expensive enough that people have to password share in order to get access to more streaming services for cheaper
"Terrible shows/movies, doesn't allow people to share accounts. Focused on only $ and not it's customers. Will be canceling my account. Go woke go broke"

Content isn't good enough to have to pay more just so family that doesn't live at home year round can use our shared account. They're basically over charging people for not having a nuclear family.

I have had this for several months I enjoy all the movies I am able to watch
greedy bastards
It's absolutely insane that I can't log in to whatever device I want ON MY OWN ACCOUNT because of this new crack down on password sharing. I pay to watch the content as I please. I don't pay to be forced to only watch the content only at my home residence. Beyond ridiculous. Subscription canceled. Won't be coming back
The netflix is really good...Also i rate this app 500/500
Password crackdown is greedy and makes me think it may not be worth it. It should be like a family plan not household.
Just trying to watch an episode of Suits the past 2 days and it gets to a certain point and won't play. Netflix is as garbage as they come. I'm cancelling after writing this review.
Just trying to start using this app
Terrible and they made it hard to uninstall
"To expensive, can't use on other devices away from home. Not worth your time anymore."
Awful after this region lock bs had to unblock my phone 3 times cause i travel
Junk i hope Netflix goes under
"Everything was fine until they killed password sharing. However the shows aren't good enough to pay a membership and half for. The quality has drastically dropped (see the new Cleopatra ""documentary"" for an example) and their way of fixing dropping revenue is charging the fools who stick around more for the same slop. It's been a long time coming and I hope they really feel it with this one."
I live in the Rockies and it is slow to load if it loads at all.
Can you bring back Minecraft story mode
Much better
Get use to the one stars and losing subscribers anlog with their money. Everyone I know and a bunch on Facebook or unsubscribing as soon as they friends and family gets kicked. Since we can't share u going to stop charging to watch on multiple screens? Your future does not look so good Netflix
Keeps asking me to finish signing up but i already have my account. It only happens on my phone. Other devices no problem. It's annoying
I enjoyed this service but between changing emails and then changing phone numbers and then also the fact that I shared this particular site with someone who I should not have for my own protection which makes me question exactly how much data That particular person got from me because I know there was an order of protection between us but I bet he had access to what I used on here
Greedy company
Love it
Money grabbers
Awesome
Since my kids can't have access to the account since they live with their mom I won't be renewing my subscription
There's no more good shows or movies. And it keeps on freezing for no reason.
"Demanding I add my personal address, so I can't use it from my office and house now, I'm so done. Netflix is replaceable"
"Terrible catalog of subpar material, now you can't even use your immediate family members account."
If im paying 20 plus a month I should be able to watch Netflix where ever I want if we can only watch it in one house the price should be lowered
you can have fun while waching
its good for healing haha
Great
"Imagine being greedy enough to stop people from account sharing. That's one of the best things about streaming services, sharing it with family, and now you can't."
Its pretty obvious lol
Hope you go under

stop restricting and charging people unnecisarily when your app isnt even worth the fee you have no right to track peoples locations or devices and trying to forcefully take peronal data like that so you can charge them more will lose you all of your subscibers
I'm no longer able to cast to tv from the app.
i love this but when does demon slayer season 4 come out

"Our family has used Netflix for over a decade. The original draw? We could share the accou t as a family, even while traveling or in our seperate homes. Our family cancelled our subscription today, for that draw has been revoked. How ludicrous of an idea to only let people use Netflix, the main source of MOBILE streaming, in their home. I'll stick with Peacock and YouTube."
Greedy company just lost a sub. Used to split the costs with my family but can't share anymore. Not worth it just to watch shows that never get more than 1 season. Anything worth watching is on the other services or the high seas
"I'm tired of the prices constantly going up, now in addition to that you are preventing password sharing. If I pay for the most expensive version of the subscription it shouldn't matter to you who I let watch it. You think this will help you make more money? Think again I'm canceling my subscription effective immediately."
Love is $8
Love love love love this app I use it all the time

Sometimes it may stall in viewership or how many members or on line also your lineup is Skewed to occasionally viewership us retired vets need more from your end
They fixed the problem that made my app next to unusable a few days after I mentioned the issue. Bravo! #GoodShow
"Good selection of shows but it's too expensive to even experience it! I used to have a Netflix account for a long time but with the new rule that requires you to be connected to a ""home network"" there's no longer a use for it since I'm normally not home very often. Majority of the time I watch Netflix when im on the move and theres free time but now im unable to. Thanks Netflix for ruining your app."
Waste of time
"Utter trash, ui is pretty much useless, far overpriced for mediocre content"
This new update is garbage. You are supposed to be able to have 4 separate profiles on premium subscription. Why are they restricting where they can be located? You shouldn't have to be in the same house. Why pay for premium subscription if the best feature of it is being taken away? Make it to where the profiles we paid for can be used regardless of whether or not you're in the same house. It is still only 4 profiles getting to use it regardless of where they're located.
"can be very glitchy somtims, but over all its a good app"
"Greedy company, no longer will use this horrible app"
Love Netflix
wala naman ung ibang movie na kahit sobrang tagal na wala padin haysss
Love this app brilliant films and videos tv streaming also got it all and for ¬£6-99a month you can even get a cheaper deal if required and if you watch lots of NETFLIX 2 other bigger deals available so get rid of disney and come over to an adults app with a special part for children so I say its the best one on offer off all these types of packages
"Unfriendly app. It takes 14 keystrokes to exit this app on a smart TV, and even then it tries to play you an ad. Curated content only taylored to american audience despite them knowing where you're located. Had enough so cancelled sub and uninstall."
"Bunch of liars. They lied about password sharing not being pushed into the US, and then sneakily started implementing it once everyone forgot. Your content isn't worth it anymore."
"Doing away with Netflix , keep your new corporate greed policy. Entire point of me having a Netflix is I can use it wherever I want on any device. Can't do that I just won't have it."
"A Netflix √© bom por sinal,por√©m queria que a s√©rie Anne with E tivesse continua√ß√£o a s√©rie e √≥tima, por favor der continua√ß√£o a s√©rie ü´†üôèüèªüôèüèªüôèüèªüôèüèª"
I pay for my account and should be allowed to share a password with whoever I so choose. I believe it's time to cancel and choose a different service
Awesome
Why am I forced to have Netflix on my phone. What Samsung phones do not have Netflix?
I can't uninstall Netflix from my Android. I unsubscribed because of the new password share policy. I don't want it taking up storage space. This is b.s.
How terrible is this I can't even have a look my own account if I'm not at home. What's the point having Netflix and paying every month if I can't use it.
LOVE IT! such a good app!
"Netflix has been lagging, the sound plays but not the visual. Like it's pirated."
Great App!!
Muy bueno
If I could give it 0 stars I would. Over priced for garbage. I have it for the anime exclusives once im done with all the anime im just gonna get rid of Netflix. Cancel everything good but keep making seasons for garbage shows that hold no value
"Unsubscribing due to the very classist new password sharing policy. Greedy companies do not deserve our money, time, or support."
Very user friendly.
Best
"Pelo amor de deus, e os pobres??? Muito ruim cobrar por cada janela, n√£o recomendo mais!!!"
Nit sure at the moment
Bye Netflix
They charge you just so THEY can choose who gets to use it. Hulu doesn't do that.
Making me pay extra money for somebody who doesn't live with me to watch Netflix is absurd. I already pay $21 GOODBYE Netflix!!!
Always liked Netflix
I'm so mad. I would cancel the account if it was mine!
Hope Netflix goes bankrupt
So good!
"I can't use it if I'm not home. Netflix has LOST my patronage. Why am I paying for 6 screens if I can't use them all?? My family has been using Netflix since it was a mail order DVD rental service back when blockbuster still existed. Now instead of feeding into their cash-grabby greedy hands, instead of $20/month they're now making $0. I hope others follow suit and CANCEL NETFLIX!"
It is good and enjoyable
They actually said to share your password with friends and family just a few years ago and now they're going back on it. Never buying again
"I hate this company for trying to limit my access to things I pay for, I'm canceling"
NEW password sharing ban = 1 star
"I give it 3. My brother wanted to change his profile picture, but there was nothing he wanted. He likes ninjago, so can you please add ninjago profile pictures?"
This is a very good app for watching movies
Can't sign in. Always goes on about something that went wrong.
"Netflix doesn't open on my mobile device anymore, it just gets stuck after showing the logo and Netflix. Please fix it ASAP"
Trash content that just gets cancelled anyway
Ever since Netflix removed ratings it's hard for me to find quality shows. I have to resort to checking Google for the rating which is inconvenient. Also it keeps getting more expensive without getting any better.
Trying to charge me more for my family using netflix because we live in separate households. Yeah nah. Kiss my 30 bucks a month goodbye.
"Horrible to have to pay for the 5 screens (premium HD) and now have to pay an additional fee for my mom whom doesn't live with me. Greedy company, loved you guys for 12 years, but this is it for us."
Love this is available while out and about. Also being kept in touch with what is coming soon.
What does beta programme is full mean?
"Terrible experience dealing with yet another mega corporation only concerned with finding new ways to take more of your money and give you least amount in return that you will accept all while smiling in your face and pretending to be your buddy. More of the same trash, which in fact, is mostly what they make these days."
Greedy price increases with no good content. No point in paying for 4K when I don't have four screens that I can actually use.
Watched shameless with a 3 yr old...
"Huge battery drain, forces you to go into the settings and stop it every day. Also, a very greedy corporation"
Hardly any good movies. And so many Spanish and Chinese movies that have been dubbed. Canceling my subscription and getting Disney plus instead.
Egypt for Egyptianüá™üá¨
"Disappointed üòû I guess I'm going to cancel Netflix now that they want to charge for each account I share with my family. It's already 19 for the extra access. Good luck I rather close this. It's sad that if they don't know how to bring new customers, then they would rather make the ones they have paid double or more for the same consumption."
"Netflix sucks now, we should be able to share passwords. You don't care for the people."
Awesome
"It would be nice to be able to adjust the contrast settings in app like a computer monitor, everything plays way too dark. I don't see it as an option to adjust with any of my devices."
"Good app, good movies, but The dumb programme can't detect that the same device has 2 tabs open, I had 2 tabs open which were netflix, I was trying to watch Netflix on one of them but netflix thought it was 2 devices trying to watch at one"
Why is my news feed now gone?
Well no ads and it is the best on all the movie watcher I have ever met
"Absolute trash app and company. This app has no good shows, terrible quality, buggy, slow and expensive. Not worth paying for, just pirate their content."
Email address and I'll will contact
"Stupid business deccisions like ""an account has to be used at one address, confirm devices"". Purchase HBO max, it's better"
User experience has become useless since previous versions
Screw your crackdown!
This app is Great I love it
Money hrst
Love it
Cleaner
So stupid
"Uninstalling, I don't have condition to pay, used to watch from my uncle, who apparently is not family anymore, anyways, good luck with losing more audiences. Now you will have a more legit reason to cancel your shows."
i cant uninstall the app on my phone android
App not working
Excellent
Awful content and poor selection.
Bekar
Good
Excellent
i dooo no
"Well, they really did it it now. I just cancelled and I won't be back until they lower the price."
We should be allowed to share our account that we pay for with our family members! We are a military family and not always going to be living in the same house. We are not going to pay more for what we was already getting.
I love Netflix especially right now that it have Spanish soap opera and good movies and shows I do recommend Netflix
This app is completely useless now that Netflix made the dumbest business decision I've ever seen and made it so you have to declare a home address or wifi. How are you supposed to watch on the go now? If I could give negative stars I would.
It would be fabulous if my X-HUSBAND MOTHER AND DAUGHTER didn't f****** hack it!!!!!!!
Nice app
Just wasting money subbed to this especially now.
Nice
Rubbish not opening why?
Love movies
Maganda naman pero at maayos walang lag at loading screen may subtitle din at audio
Just love it I don't know why
"When changing/accessing profile lock password on the website, it should require the password (and send it to email in case it's forgotten), otherwise the whole parental and maturity control doesn't work. You could be sharing your account with kids, they could simply log into the web, know your profile lock code (currently by providing the account passpord) and then access your profile and access whatever content they want"

Without password sharing there's no reason to pay for a subscription anymore.
I've been with Netflix for 11 years üòÅ and it might not have the movies on it but it's best movie app in my mind. That's what I think. People are on tiktok are trash talking Netflix so that's why I posted this
Just uninstall this app
Best app for watch movies and tv shows i just watched mrs chatterjee vs norway and i m watching demon slayer experience is so good‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è
"I decided to quit cause they kept raising their prices, wanted to come back and subscribe then I realized that I don't use it enough to justify it and I can't even have it for my family because the new sharing thing."
"Stupid greedy and canceled. I'm the one that pays for Netflix. Two people are able to use Netflixs. If I want my sister to be the second person or if I want to use my Netflix at a different address, then there shouldn't be a problem. How are u going 2 dictate who my two users are and where they can live. This will be my last month subscribing."
Me and my boyfriend share a premium account he spends a lot of time in Indiana with family if we can no longer share one Netflix we will cancel our account. We barely use it and will not pay more.

"Omg i don't know what to say. I just download netflix recently but whenever every movie i reach, i can't watch satifily bother be with strip in screen can't even watch a movie."
I've experienced good quality shows
Very good
Good
It's a good app
Netflix has gone greedy forcing us to pay for every user outside of your house.
Says that I have too many downloads although they are few and I have a lot of space to download more.Please fix the issue
The only way to get 4k res is to pay $22/month. What a scam
Very entertaining
Netflix is definitely not worth the money
This app üòä
I wish you'd guy put the original charmed back on there to be honest I love the original one
Easily accessible
Nor enough Content in Kannada
"The ""password sharing"" situation just made it so much harder to watch things, regardless of whether you live in the same household or not."
Rarely gets good movies or shows. Too expensive for something that gets old movies and rarely gets updated movies or shows
Does not have all the movies üòî
I dont wants to subscribe and pay you Happy without Netflix.
Netflix is the best
The worst everü´§ü´§ü´§

"""Love is sharing a password""-Netflix. Now requiring you to pay extra for sharing said password. Canceling my subscription now."
"Disappointed in the decision to no longer allow account sharing (especially when our account is just shared bt my parents, brother and myself aka immediate family). Will be happily switching to other streaming services."
Superb
I love all the new episodes that add into every single show I like that they add it's what that's new I like the adding so much new episodes to so many of the amazing and quick shows I'd like to see off Netflix it's the best
"Password sharing crackdown broke the camels back. This constant nickel and diming bs is getting old fast. Feeling like a struggling platform milking every last penny out of people in an attempt to save itself. Unsubscribed a while ago and I don't miss it, plenty of great content on Prime and Disney."
People away from your location can't use Netflix anymore.
Netflix not working from past few days. How to resolve it ??
Now we have to pay to share our account with our family/close friends. Deleting it.
I used to love this app. What is wrong with Netflix lately the app never works. its either slow or freezes or kicks you off. I pay to much for that (You raised the price). Majority of the movies and shows are not even in English and can't watch. So wth am I paying for?! Canceling! Netflix took off all the Christian movies?!

Hate the new pricing.
"The mighty have fallen. Netflix use to be a great alternative to cable. Now they are just as bad as cable. They are less concerned with providing entertainment and more concerned with stuffing their pockets and it shows. Quality, variety, and service steadily go down as prices go up. Maybe try another streaming service for awhile. I know i will be."
No. Kannada movies
Good
Cool
Please implement a category where listed shows are about to be removed. It's troublesome having to keep check third party websites. Edit: Utterly disappointed with the account block based on IP. Such money grubbers. I hope business goes downhill for y'all.

Im very happy with Netflix use
Exceptional. Three üëç thumbs up!
Has some interesting content that I normally wouldn't watch (which are enjoyable but yet again has some absolute rubbish - great there is a remove from continue watch option. It'll be nice to have more mainstream films that aren't at least 5 years old and/or are mostly really bad films - noticed most of the top ten films in my country have been on netflix before. Seems a little slow to upload (my wifi is fine) and noticed little glitching when downloading while watching something else.

"Peace out, you're going to lose a lot of customers first, your price I was fine with at first, but now yall doing to much I rather go with a better streaming service yall need smarter people on your board not greedy ones I wonder how many people going unsubscribe I got a big family I'll make sure they know what your up to. it's just entertainment"
"Will not connect to my chrome cast all the other devices connect fine. Been on the phone for over a hour, disconnected everything uninstall apps and still nothing. Not friggen happy"
This app is pretty good but can you add the rest of one piece
So for years I've been paying the extra money for four screens so the kids could stream also. Now because they moved out all sudden it's a big deal and they want to charge me an extra 7.99 per kid after I've already been paying for those extra screens for years. No thank you canceled
Netflix made me beleive something is wrong with my chromecast wherein all other applications are working fine.

"I wish you will do the two factor authentication instead of letting us pay more. So that those who're not in the same household cannot access the account. To those people who purchase netflix and offer it illegally, please stop."

Good

I don't like it anymore because someone else is using my account. I am done with Netflix.
I signed in and it keeps showing incorrect password I had to try my friends log in same thing why is it like that
Amazing service

Not good
Good service.
Money grabbing so an so's DO NOT WHATEVER YOU DO USE NETFLIX APPS they are no longer usable in the UK unless you are sat in your registered address I'd recommend using amazon or Disney instead Netflix is dead
Awesome
"Greedy. The fact that I now can't use the Netflix that I pay for, for my mother and sisters and I but just because we don't live in the same house anymore we can't use the same account weve been using. It's no different than multiple people in the same house data wise. It's just straight up greed when youre already the most popular streaming platform and don't need the profit. Could I pay for another account to then be paying for both? Yes but should I have to? Absolutely not."

Password sharing is there anymore to say?
I really love that app
"Our family has been paying for Netflix since it replaced Redbox and Blockbuster. For two decades half of my life. Now I can't share a profile with my disabled family member next door because she has her own WiFi. Trying to increase revenue. We cancelled our subscription today and moved to HBO Max, Disney + and Hulu. They have better content anyways. Never returning to Netflix. Watch your stocks fall fast you cheap..."
Excellent
How to log in ?
Why is Netflix digging their own grave?
"On March 10, 2017 Netflix tweeted ""Love is sharing a password."" Apparently Netflix doesn't love their customers anymore."
Marathi Content are less than other
"Lack of decent content. Finding good shows to watch is becoming harder and harder to do lately since i don't want to start a great compeling series just to have it be canciled before a conclusion or having the final season be cut short, but hollow dime a dozen shlock shows get upwards of 4 season when the good series are lucky to get even 2. I hope things change and that the higher ups actually change things for the better and stop giving shows the axe before the show's able to be completed."
Absolutely love it
If I could rate leas I would but I'm not gonna deal with the new rules for it when it's own shows are ok at best and would rather spend my money on other apps instead. It was good but now it is being ridiculous with the new rules if anyone is wanting to there are other websites or even pther apps that can provide better service then this
"This app came preinstalled on my mobile phone, it worked fine but for a few months the playback is all lagged and jerkey. I have done all troubleshooting and contacted netflix support but to no avail, because this app came preinstalled I can't reitall it in hopes that it nay work. Thanks to this all I can't use Netflix at all on my mobile phone TRASH APP TRASH SUPPORT."
I have a problem downloading on Netflix it always stop at 98%....
"Update sucks, you know it, greedy."
content wise a good app but there were problems when i first downloaded it on my android but then they eventually resolved.
"Update: Unusable in a dark room because of intense brightness. No response nor fixes from Netflix suggesting they don't care about user experience. I've subscribed since the beginning, thinking of cancelling. Original: The app overrides brightness settings and sets it far too bright and makes the app unusable in a dark room. The Netflix menus maintain system brightness levels, but when playing a video it blasts you with excess brightness! I spent an hour trying to find a work around to no avail."
‚ù§Ô∏è
This is a complete travesty. Netflix once boasted about the freedom to share accounts. If I pay for 4 screens I should be able to watch them where I want to. It‚Äôs now costing me $26 per month and I won't be allowed to share with my girlfriend unless I pay extra $8. Netflix can take a long walk off a short plank. I am going to cancel my subscription. I ask others to please do the same. We are being gouged.
Removes the blue light filter on your phone and increases the brightness. You have brightness control through the app but it does not reach the lowest brightness settings. It's impossible to watch at night.
Very entertaining...! Love it !
Really Netflix? This is what was all about to share with family even though you don't live together. You're becoming to greedy and you just shot yourself in the foot with this move.
Adi√≥s Netflix.
Bad
Good
Extra charge to shared account üòë
Best OTT platform
"Shows have been low quality recently and are unwatchable. Also, the new monetization of charging family members who do not live in the home to keep their account is ludicrous. DO NOT GIVE MONEY TO THIS GREEDY COMPANY."
App is buggy. The content offered does not justify the price of a subscription. I recommend looking for a differnet streaming service.
Goodbye netflix - too expensive now you have to pay for every user in family
"Greed. Should've been happy being such a popular streaming service but no, gotta now lock people out of shared accounts. Unsubscribing."
Interesting ‚ò∫Ô∏è‚ò∫Ô∏è
"i lovvvvvvvvve netflix but they may not have many movies you are looking for, they do have movies you might be interested in though!!!"
It's not wonderful

Difficult to redo signin ..
"Why not allow to take screenshots when crack websites already exists allowing us to freely take them and not to mention no ability to change video quality neither on pc or phone!! Even if I have the ultra HD plan and a working 120mbps wifi connection it will still play some vids at 720p and sometimes 1080p!? Why is 4k only limited to Microsoft edge!? Rs. 649 per month is a total waste of money, I rather stick with crack websites üòî"
I love watching movies in netflix.
Thats grateful

Sad to see how things have shifted. Canceling soon..
"The new password sharing is just a ploy to get more money. I'll be taking my business elsewhere, thanks. I remember when this company was a good one. Not anymore."
"Telling people they have to pay to share an account if they dont live in the same house is horrific. What about college kids? Parents or elderly couples in nursing homes? People woth kids or family that has to stay in the hospital? People doing a stay abroad program? Truckers? Traveling nurses? There's SO MANY this app isn't thinking of. Moreover, they CANCEL all their good shows & stop getting series we care about. I deleted my account because of all this & I won't be back until they fix it."
so cool but does not have disney movies
Netflix not opening
"nice app although there are adds but not very many, like at all so awesome all highly recommend but you do have to pay so if I are a child then don't get without permission"

"Alot of bugs like with "" floor is lava it would glitch and it would look like they are flying üò≠ü•¥üò™üëÅüëÑüëÅ"
USED to be a great service but I refuse to pay for something I cannot use wherever I am. I realize I'm just a drop in the bucket but I encourage others to do the same. Dropping Netflix so long as it only permits watching at one residence. It's not practical for a modern family.
The most important movie's to me is not existd in this trashy app
Great
Can't share passwords anymoreüëéüñï
"""Love is sharing a password"""
"Everytime I open the app on my phone, Roku or laptop I always have an issue. The slowness of scrolling, sound not syncing with video, the loading time for anything I click taking 5 minutes or more to load. Seriously needs to be worked on."
hate mi life yf
lmfao the 5 star reviews on here are so fake. 5 stars shouldn't read like a quick advertisement. Also nobody likes those stupid games. If the games are in a five star review it's gotta be fake. Netflix needs to offer an option to filter out the international stuff. I'm sure that content is ok if you speak the language. The dubbing is atrocious and makes it so I can't even watch it. If they don't offer it soon I'll start watching the few Netflix titles in English on on those free movie
The year it was released & it's actors aren't a description of the film! How the am I supposed to choose a film if I don't know what it's about! You had one job! FFS!
New update and household guidlines are just a moneygrab and they just get more and more bold about how they screw other people over.

Family has to be in the same internet?? So stupid
Netflix is a awesome application that comes with wide and vast choices if your into mermaid and nymphs or any other fantasy movie cravings there is a section on netflix for that wanna go action all day long theres a section like that drama lover? Perfect! Netflix Has NetFlix genre for all of those stuff or your just a anime lover theres a section for that aswell netflix brings everything you need or want....I suggest you join Right now the Movies And Series AWAIT!
Nah .. just a money grab now. Canceled. Not coming back.
Keeps losing my place on shows I'm trying to watch. Oftentimes I'll leave and the show will start two epidodes back. You'd really think an issue like this wouldn't happen anymore.
"What's the point of this app now if you have to be connected to a single ""home wifi"" to access your account? This new password sharing block is pure corporate greed and entirely classist. What about people living in trailers and RVs who connect to new wifi as they travel? What about college students away from home? Military family members overseas? I hope your sales tank after this, you cancel all your good shows and now have the audacity to try and limit who uses our accounts. Absolute bull."
I will be cancelling my subscription and going to Crave. Been a member since 2014 and paid extra for 4+ screens now you want more money for just my dad using my netflix.
Pretty audacious to not pay your writers and then turn around and demand more money from us. ü§®
"Netflix really is a joke. I'll never pay for Netflix again because of this crack down on password sharing. I split it with my mom, we both are getting rid of it because of this insane practice. It won't be long and Netflix will be remembered like blockbuster only less fondly."
"""Love is sharing a password."" üòÇ"
Used to be good now content isn't America isn't even English its poorly dubbed garbage and the few good shows it has isn't worth the money when u can get the disney hulu bundle and watch wherever you are WITHOUT paying for another account just because you have 2 houses.
Small mind energy yet big paycheck and bonuses to people that dont even do any real work. CEO fat cats thirsty for your tidbits. You were the favorite of the family for years. Now I gotta tell my brother I like Disney better ffs he never going to let it go.
((?(?((7k**?? L ?
Lol to many subscription services these days. Need to many to watch a few shows. So cya later and thanks for putting me back onto downloads. Their so fast these days with fast internet and unlimited data. Goodluck with this household shake down.
"Netflix hates money, and it's customers. Subscription canceled"
"Nova forma da divis√£o de telas √© horr√≠vel, estarei deixando o streaming"
"Stingy apps, keep digging our pockets"
"7.99 extra to share my account with the my own family that lives in another country?. Seriously pathetic. Worst streaming service and app. Unsubscribed! Will use ""other ways"" of streaming. Never this pathetic god forsaken app."
"It,me or the computer just isnt jiven"
"Worthless, can't even watch anything anymore. Netflix apparently is shoving their noses where they don't belong. Family's can no longer share a account and enjoy shows and movies, it is none of Netflix's business what family's do with their own account we pay for. So we will no longer support Netflix, we're removing this app and moving to better applications. Netflix hopefully will figure out the mistake they have made."
Trash
Bad company
The login isn't working for me
"I remember now why I went back to Hulu. I'll have to make the switch again I guess since Netflix still continues to make shows and not continue them,makes me livid! If something is going to stop because y'all to lazy to continue it then dont even start it. You have plenty unfinished seasons and I guarantee your upsetting ppl and not just me. Downloads still won't load and when I have wifi it still doesn't load."
Good
Cancelled netflix due to high cost cant even share the 4 profiles to family members on other location. Better watch pirated netflix on streaming website. Jokes on you netflix you'll get less customer more than ever
Ridiculous having to pay extra when I'm already getting charged near $30 a month! I know the economy isn't going well lately but that is no excuse for trying to increase YoY/MoY revenue to make up for the lost free flowing cash!
"Amazing, very relaxing, while watching thers no commercial break.. Thank you so much."
Querendo espremer o usu√°rio at√© a √∫ltima. Cancelamento j√° !
I had a wonderful experience.
Terrible originals making it cost more and making them apply rules that didnt matter before they started blowing money on terrible originals. Sad netflix is following blockbuster in stupid decisions.
"Still netflix and a little late, but the built in brightness bar sucks, I don't know who's idea it was but it's very inconvenient getting flashbanged when I close netflix at 2 in the morning."
Netflix has devoted itself to greed.
"Dogshit, my mother can't afford to add Netflix to her budget my sister has 2 children I help them by letting them use my Netflix. I hope everyone cancels and you crumble."
ŸÉŸàÿ¥Ÿä..üëå
Just updated the app and its not working anymore üòï
Lol idiots finally put in the 1 location per account guess its time to unsubscribe the shows are pretty trash and was only worth because we could share it. Cya.
barely works after this newest garbage. can't even scroll without buffering. all other apps/internet/wifi works great in my house.

"Netflix is so greedy you cant decide who has access to your own account anymore they do and they'll lock you all out it you don't comply. A small start up that used to be great is no better than a disgusting corprorate sell out like the rest . Hope you're proud of yourself Netflix, you just became one of the worst streaming platforms in existence!"
Want to watch it on your TV when you can watch it on your small device yeah it doesn't make sense but hey if you don't have a TV playing around or you're moving I did not mean to say playing around but anyways if you don't have a TV but you don't have your Netflix account on well this app is for you
Very cool
"Pago o plano mais caro pra 5 pessoas e agora n√£o pode mais ter 5 pessoas no plano sem verificar identidade com o bloqueio do compartilhamento de senhas. Eu estou pagando pra 5 pessoas, n√£o deveria importar de onde elas acessam. E o plano com an√∫ncios? 3 minutos de an√∫ncio pra um filme de uma hora e meia √© uma piada pra quem paga por isso."
I enjoy the movies very much on netflix
Okay
"Used this for the longest time but with the password sharing crackdown, I am getting rid of Netflix."
"Not compatible, my phone's not compatible with the version of the app? This is new, if you have the app don't delete it just to see cause you might not be able to redownload it"
Getting rid of this App due to changes they are making. They don't have good shows anymore and the price I'm paying is not worth what your getting anymore
Thanksssss
"They HouseHold thing is going in effect. Why does it matter where we are, we have to pay extra for streaming on multiple screens already. I will not be redownloading. This is disgusting."
Good show
Same movies over and over and keeps on lagging
the new update is not it fix it
"I stay in multiple locations and im not always with my family. Not gonna pay twice for this and less with free hulu ,free hbo max and free peacock. Goodbye netflix."
Money hungry h@es i hope they go bankrupt. Only reason why i have it because it is free for tmobile users. Really hope they fail like all the rest of the streaming apps
I pay for screens. It shouldn't matter what screens I use. I don't have home wifi I only use data. Just money hungry prices. And to top it off they're always canceling good shows.
"This app is always freezing, loading, and playing the audio while stuck at 25%. Now they want me to pay extra money to share my account with my family. Disappointing. Not at all worth the money."
"You are great for your movies,and I love you thank you Netflix"
Very bad
"Apparently, already paying for multiple streams isn't enough for Netflix and they decided to double dip, which isn't a good look. Next up are going to be required year long contracts like cable and then we'll be back to renting individual shows (honestly, the return of the rental store would at least allow you to ""share"" your ""password""; DVD, VHS, Bluray rentals all allow you to share). Going with the competition."
"Well I'm not in love with Netflix seems like every thing is a series episode 1,2,3,4,5,6,7 ect. Tubi Is free Hulu is free an they have better movies an showsü§îüòísorry."
BEST APP EVER!!!but I wish they posted a few disney movies
Please add all movies for all regions üôÉ
Netflix changed the nature of the service and it is no longer useful. Being unable to share my account with my children (who use it way more than I do) makes it not worth the money or trouble.
Netflix is super cool but annoying üò°
"I pay for 4k streaming, and to make it affordable I split the cost with a freind and we share the account because of that. Netflix new policy stikes me as nothing but greed, I'll be unsubscribing."
Thank u very much
"After all the price increases.. the password sharing removal was the last straw. Even after paying the highest tier for additional screens and allowing password sharing for over a decade, they just want more and more money from me. Member since 2014 and glad they made the decision easy for me."
It's a really good app
Whoever decided to remove password sharing is an idiot and should be fired. What an idiotic business plan
Bye! Enjoy your password sharing crackdown.
"It is very easy to set up, and I love that we have parental control."
Bye Netflix.
I love the shows but it needs more marvel movies
Great on the anime ones just release all the series that are already out Other wise it's good
My Netflix isn't working from past few days and it's so irritating ... Netflix you should go through the services that you are poviding to us IMPROVE ASAP !!!
So bad
4 screens means 4 screens
very good

Really good movies and shows

Good luck with all the people canceling their subscriptions thanks to your bs password sharing ban. Bye Bye.
Boo boo
Has good originals but I can't support the choice to block people from their accounts. Was a good streaming service for a lotta years but turned to money grabbing like everyone else. I'd rather watch YouTube üíÄ

Extremely disappointed in there business practices. Charging an additional fee and anti password sharing. Shame on them.
I really liked the app but I have been having problems with it I can't watch anything because the screen goes black but the soundtrack is still playing or it keeps on freezing I don't have any connection problems I tried updating the app and resetting my device but I still have the same outcome if the problem can't be resolved I am afraid it might be time to cancel my account...

Netflix is so amazing because it has many series of shows and lots of great movies. It always brings new and interesting things for me to watch.
Setting Bad business practice in India. Force people to select auto pay option. Do not allow people to pay them monthly. So they can snach money from your account every month without your montly approval. Its like giving your bank account key to them.
Netflix is greedy af

We can not reach your Netflix service plz try again later. (-1009)

Bad app
Unsubscribed because they are banning password sharing and their content is lacking nowadays.
"Horrible decision to make the service ""household based"". What about professions where you travel? Using it while on vacation? Such a greedy money grab with 0 incentive to stay."
"I used to get DVDs delivered, and when the streaming service started, I was happy to pay $6.99. I have defended and stuck with Netflix through all the lost content and price increases. Sheer greed has ruined this platform, and I can't justify paying close to $30/month just so my mother can enjoy it with me. I suggest anyone thinking of joining should look at cheaper alternatives. üè¥‚Äç‚ò†Ô∏èüè¥‚Äç‚ò†Ô∏èüè¥‚Äç‚ò†Ô∏è"
All the shows suck
Great
The downloaded videos on my account are all hanging. Why is that?
Was happy about this app but hearing the news lately is bugging me a lot when it's on about banning sharing your account with family member or friend no offence were paying for an app that basically has the same stuff on all the time and we dont have options to watch anything and everything you want were I can go online and stream any movie any tv show that I want without saying no results found or similar if we had a Netflix were everything including new releases from this year then sure
It shows Netflix only mind you i paid my fee for this app
I try to sign in into Netflix but the keep on saying my email can't be verified
Payment method is not accepting payment for debit and credit card specially the cvv.. please fix the issue
Do we have to pay for netflix
"So excited to cancel my membership once you decide to make my family pay more bc we aren't always in the same house together. College students exist and we're still legally apart of our parents household, yet you'll kick me out of the account every 30 days for ""not being apart of the Netflix household"" bs. Hope all your stocks plummet and you go the way of blockbuster."

"What used to be the best streaming service is now a money-grubbing shell of what it used to be. For all the price increases they've done over the years all they've done is cancel the actually good shows and mass produced these dystopian, reality-dating shows. There's been a major shift from creativity to productivity and after all the price hikes and rumors of ads and now locking multiple devices behind a pay wall, I will be terminating my service and waiting for it to go the way of blockbuster."

Netflix going back on what made them so great to start and punishing users for having friends and family. I hope it drops users and revenue.
LMAOO they charge you for different households. Money hungry. Buy anything else. Also woke shows pushed upon kids. This is disgusting. Awful app.

"I think that one star is too much for this program, Netflix. I don't think I should evaluate a program that supports forgery even. It's the program that includes the Queen Cleopatra movie, where our Egyptian history is falsified with very wrong information. Queen Cleopatra is Egyptian, and Egypt is for Egyptians. Stop saying this. The wrong one and this documentary is a very funny movie for me"
The selections we chose are good but we would enjoy more UK series and movies

"Netflix has started to send warning emails to UK customers who are sharing their accounts with people ""outside their household"". The streaming giant said a Netflix account was ""for use by one household"" with a ban on sharing passwords now in place. Anyone who wants to share their account must pay ¬£4.99 to do so. I get it for free and I genuinely don't want to. I contacted netflix to remove an account from my tv which is permanently logged in and was met with a ""can't help you"" thanks devapriya"
Bad
"Trash. Instead of making better content they raise prices, take away account sharing (which they said its Love a few years ago) and want to charge extra if I go on holiday. Unsubbed. Great job, looking forward to the news when Netflix is losing more money. Maybe HBO will make a series about ""Netflix, what not to do""."
I have 2 homes. They want to charge me an extra 8$ a month on top of the 16$ I was paying. So my family can watch Netflix from my house. I got a job in a different state. I got an apartment closer to work. I already pay enough just to have the 2 homes. 2 electric bills 2 everything. I'm not paying for 2 Netflix accounts with the new policy. I just canceled my account. I hope more people with multiple homes don't give in to their new policy.

Customer service is really good love watching movies too
This is the best app ever created
Good app
"Pretty great app, I approve. The reason why it isn't getting 5 stars is because there's a glitch where when you're watching a show and then you turn your device on and off, it freezes and you have to restart your device, but overall, very good. Edit: dear netflix, you annihilated my entire childhood (minecraft story mode) i will never forgive you for this."
Do I need to tell you why....
Love Netflix

"Used to be the greatest streaming service, now they're just greedy. Canceling after this crackdown on password sharing ruins my family's ability to use Netflix."
"This policy against password sharing with friends, partners and family who don't live with us is a big nonsense."
Demon slayer Hindi mein Dab karo
Bad
Password crackdown hurts kids from divorced families. Cancel it. To marry steaming options to be slowed down by Netflix. Nonsense
no Star wars.. what a lame
"This horrible app blocks you every time you travel pretending that it's for your own ""account safety"" then they start demanding more money.... Total extortion racket. I'm getting so fed up with this garbage so I just canceled my subscription after being a Netflix user for 20 years since the DVD-by-mail days. They can go screw with someone else with this garbage."

"Love the movies that are made by people in the occult that keep spells in our minds to brainwash us that we are just corporate property and don't share any info with us about frequencies and the 15 dimensions to keep us from our true abilites in my opinion. The thing is, I don't care for the dumb new rule to pay almost 8 dollars extra for my dad to use it at his house. Now that's criminal. Anyways, just wanted to exercise freedom of speech and share about my opinion on Netflixs new changes!"
Really good exclusives
Too money hungry. Execs need to be eaten
"netflix is a good app i guess. one thing though, they keep taking all the good shows off to make space for the new ones which most of the time are really bad, if im being totally honest, the only thing keeping netflix popular is stranger things"
Actually going through with the multiple household thing? That plus the quality of your shows and specials going severely downhill? Garbage. I'm out. Have fun with your scam.
"I'm having difficulties playing my series (Girl From Nowhere) once I got done watching one episode it continues to say ""Cannot play the video please try again later"". What I do not understand is why it's saying that because it's not my network or my phone. If Netflix is having problems please do fix the issue immediately."

"Account sharing? Let's hope the people at Netflix are smarter than the bozos at hue lights (have 70 bulbs , literally thousand on hue) but have TWO residences, throw in a Lake house, that's 3.

Utter garbage. Paying chunk of my savings for this app to be stuck on the loading screen.
"The lag, buffering, audio tears, etc. Are out of control. I know it's not our internet bc we pay for the best we can get (work & multiple gamers) and while every other streaming and gaming service runs with beautiful fps, Netflix whether streaming or just scrolling titles, has a melt down. The app is unusable on our phones and on our smart TVs. Most advice is relating back to our internet service which is funny at this point. Will cancel service, unusable app."

Keeps telling me too many people are watching when I know for a fact only 2 screens are using the service which is what I pay for. Keeps happening. Pretty sure I'll be cancelling this service soon and just stick with Disney+because there's no point in paying for a service I can't use. Killed all tasks on both screens and tried again and still only one person can use the service.

I give Netflix a three star rating as yes it's a good streaming service to have to watch movies and TV shows on but I just wish they would keep update with the seasons of shows like for example the TV show S.W.A.T with Shemar Moore is already in Season 6 but Netflix is up to only Season 5. Like why have the show on here but not all the seasons completely there just like NCIS as well as these are my two favorite shows that I'm starting to binge watch.

Sadly Netflix has continued to get worse and worse over the years. The value for money is poor. you're limited to one device. I have six streaming services and they all allow two to four devices with the standard plan (which is the same price). The app crashes and freezes a lot and there's a weird lag time with it too. If any of the series I watch were still on I could put up with the baggage but the last one just got the hatchet. Good riddance Netflix.... Don't waste your time or money.
Very good app
I can't find the show the 100 I only took subscription to watch that show on the first day I was able watch it but now I can't find it anywhere in the app I would like your team to please look into it..
Great
"Netflix STINKS... if they haven't canceled your favorite show yet, I promise they're coming for you! They cancel every good show after three seasons IF you're lucky, but often you only get one or two seasons. Stop ruining the good shows! If you won't follow through just don't start at all. Let another company pick it up so we actually get to see the full story. I gave two stars because the app is somewhat functional but there are a lot of bugs that need to be addressed. Closes randomly."

"Netflix works well, I like how you can be on a different all while still being able to watch"
Awesome
Worst

Netflix is a nice app for streaming movies and downloading series I really love this app but I can't say it's perfect because every app has its flaw's and I think Netflix flaw's is their inability to upload new movies on time or even ever because they are films that have reigned and passed but have still not enter Netflix thank you to the creator's this is a really nice app Weldone!!!

No kind of signal load it on TV next thing you know it shuts down period makes no sense

"Netflix keeps getting rid of shows I like to the point I'll just end up canceling my subscription. What next, commercials? I can't believe you got rid of New Girl. I'm at the point where I'm just going to start buying hardcopies again. It's like we're going backwards."

The new update is too bad
"Was Great, Not much options now, can be better"
Now this has started becoming a worst app. They have started removing some good movies from the platform.
"Netflix on Google TV needs the exit to be back button then popup exit message, notifications need to be gone, plus stop ripping off people with you over priced subscription. Also needs an option to remove woke Content."
It is the best apo

i rated this low just based on customer service. when an issue happens all they can say is it's not our fault but it is our fault??
Watch free
Good
They cancel every good show
Why does the search function now only take you to a list of genres. Seems others are having troubles with this useless update
"It's a good app and I love the content. However, team Netflix if you read my review please consider introducing password lock for all the shared accounts seperately in a way that others won't be able to remove the account look..... I would like to have my privacy even while sharing accounts. Please."

I am facing this issue almost 2 months..I hav being very patience but now I couldn't ... Plz do fix this issue
This apps so good to use for kids and adults... The quality is so good. But some times they lag.... thank you Netflix

it has been so long and the whole brightness issue is still unsolved. please remove controls of brightness from your incompetent app. I can't forking see ANYTHING it's so DARK!!!!
There's been a lot of sudden skips taking things back about a second or two. Very jarring.
Why do you guys cancel all of the good shows and leave us with a billion shows that are terrible? How can you expect them to get viewership if you refuse to promote the show? Literally the fourth show I find out is canceled due to it not getting enough views.
"Good app, but some movies are not good"
Stop canceling my favorite shows.

This is the best feature for me..

And other cartoon brands. Thank you so much for your time and have a great day!!!!"

Its amazing and easy to download
"DOWNLOADED EPISODES TO WATCH OFFLINE, WHILE I TRAVEL. HOWEVER, NOT ALLOWED TO WATCH THE ALREADY DOWNLOADED EPISODES, BECAUSE THEY'RE NOT AVAILABLE IN THE COUNTRY I TRAVELED TO. YOU HIT A ROCK BOTTOM."
Good app
I think its good stuff on there what ur into
It's fun watching movies on Netflix.
Bad experience
"Yeah, there's a reason Netflix is slowly dropping to 1 star. Making changes nobody asked for, cancelling some of their best shows to release stuff no one wants to watch, and making desperate cash grabs like disallowing account sharing, planning to insert advertisements, and for years now having screen and profile limits you have to pay to increase. These are not the traits of a winning platform, they're the features of a streaming service slowly going under. Like others have said: Netflix is offering less than other platforms, and charging more to do it."
"Hate this app, i try to use Netflix but Netflix says that too many people are using your account at the moment but no one is using at the time."
Movies are not downloading
"Bring back the Netflix series ""Cursed"" You dropped it after one season and it was SO good! Very very upset. Also, your ratings(language, violence, nudity, gore) are not accurate...please fixüß°‚úåüèª"
I love Netflix You guys stay pretty well updated on the new movies and TV shows and I love it because I can take it with me wherever I go and stay up to date on my mobile phone and you have great graphics to look at

The baddest app and company ever
It is the best app
It's easy to use but much charging on data after paying much to watch on it
Netflix is a terrible mind programming channel spreading their woke and sexual perversion ideas to the masses. They even have a disgusting show about cannibalism. No thank you!
Go woke go broke. No quality here
I am free

"Poor international selection, and they're just backpedalling by not releasing entire new series at once. Also, it'll be a miracle when they share user or critics 's ratings instead of pretending to have exclusively good movies."
Shite
This this download service so bad
"Ok, but my kids watch this all the time but I don't care. I watch it all the time"
For a pay to use app it's very substandard to several of the free apps. The TUBI movie app. Is free and far superior to NETFLIX. TUBI has a great selection of old classics and newer movies. NETFLIX has spiraled downhill in the last couple years. Highly disappointed.
Movies play fine but the prices are ridiculous

Just amazing quality feels very premium...
Netflix allows me to watch all of my favourite shows from the office to stranger things üòÄüòÄüòÄ

"The only reason I still keep an accout is because my dad likes to watch random movies. Personally I don't know what I could watch, every good show originally created was canceled, most good shows/movies are not there anymore and every new thing they release is either junk or propaganda. They keep threatening people that share their accout, that they will be charged, but soon owning a netflix accout will just be followed by a short retort: why, just torrent what you like."
This is good but account is not create
The best movie app

Erase the Cleopatra movie that offends the Egyptians and Cleopatra
Egypt
"Why do you think that Egypt is your country, that it is our country, when there is much evidence proving that Egypt is our country? I will give this program a bad rating because this is our country, our civilization and our history, and I rate it 0/10.

Egypt is for Egyptians .. stop the culture stealing and making false documentaries
"Netflix has gone down hill for sure. Not only have they added commercials, but they cancel the only good shows they have, or ruin them by recasting their best actors. I watch 3 shows. That is all they have to offer bc they keep canceling or ruining everything they produce."
Very nice
Please more Jdrama and Jmovie please
Nice and so beautiful
It is sucks anf controlled by agendas. I don't recommend participation doesn't worth it.

This is majestic
I like everything about the app since there's alot of improvement from the last Netflix version but I feel like you should start broadcasting soccer and some other sports because some users love to watch soccer through their phone's please broadcast soccer
Accha nhi hai
The app itself is ok but the content is too woke these days. Everything is black and gay no matter the historical accuracy.
So cool

But I'm sure that the same folks who couldn't afford Netflix in 2021, 2022 & 2023 to date, are the Exact Same folks who will be lucky to afford the Over-priced electricity bills we are all facing! Better to have, temporarily, added Adverts to Full Price Netflix & given it Free to those most In Need - of Everything!!"

Queen celiopatra film
This application content is horrible and lies about egyptian history
Horrible out of date service.... they just got new shows after a yr. They want customers to keep paying. Shows go to Netflix to die. Tell everyone their show is coming... 4 years later the show still hasn't come back yet. They buy a bunch of cheap foreign films and stock their library with them.... cheap indi and Korean movies... yeah squid games was good but not all are... honestly what everyone needs to do is just get Netflix every 3 months... that way they only get a quarter
Its discussing app
Good but expensive
It let me watch any shows I want
yk
It's a bad app

"SMH, I'm not a business person or anything but can't Netflix just pay to renew their contracts? Or extend its I'm tired of good shows like Ouran, heck even my little pony getting removed for some stupid adult animation like big mouth to get added. Especially when they sexualize minors? Normally it's syndrome down money up, but for Netflix, it's syndrome up money down."

Good it's good I've had it for years it's amazing it has lot of different shows on it to watch and it's easy to use
It's just bad might as well get Hulu because it actually has good shows
Keeps me informed and stressed free while watching movies
Still not optimized for 120hz. Shame.
Any problems I had were mine.

"Canceled my A/C all was good, then suddenly they re activated and charged my credit card, all my device Netflix app had been deleted. Payment was taken April 6th its May 18th and in spite of repeated follow up no refund. Netflix keeps credit card information even if you delete the account. I had to send a separate email to their privacy team to ask them to completely delete my account. Had Netflix for over 12 years canceled as it's terrible now, never coming back."

Ok
The new layout is terrible. The amount of steps you have to do to continue watching has increased from 1 to 3.
"Yeah most of all there shows suck,for 1. They're not creative enough to come up with new ideas on their own or even with help.2 what's actually good to watch on Netflix and 3. Honestly the only thing good things to watch on there is thing's you've already seen. So you'll probably be watching a series you've already seen thousand times,and they take there best stuff off there most of the time so it's like Netflix likes to intentionally hurt itself,it's like having an emo for a kid.(relatable)"
Nice
They have minimal good content to watch and the good shows never stay around. They also just keep like half of a show on their site so you have to pickup watching the 2nd half on another platform. The games they added are just an eyesore and i would never consider playing them so they can get good metrics on usage. Overall its an ok service that gets less ok every day. There is also no feedback line just customer support that is paid to sound sympathetic but not help.

"I would give it 5 stars in general, but I'm taking as much as I can because in Romania Netflix is full of errors, lately also gets blocked somehow, you can't move between accounts nor do anything else for more than 15-20 minutes is like frozen. By the way, many of the Romanian translators are not doing a good job at all...and that putting it in a delicated manner."
Simple to use
Worst app in the world

I cannot see anything it shows a black screen with sound on my phone

What does netflix have against pausing what your watching? Either way it works
Thanks for still taking my money even though i have canceled the subscription almost a week prior. Good marketing business going on. Taking all the shows worth watching off your platform AND scamming people for their money.

"Use to love Netflix. Lately I am unable to justify the $26 month charge as I watch at most 3 to 5 shows, docs, movies a month. Best for me to sign up every 4 months for 1 month. Then wait until new content is worth the money. Quality docs, some series, but asian shows n dubbed intl shows need cc'ss, ugh! At first, the limited series docs attracted me. Nothing new of quality."
Perfect

OK it is cool but I money üí∞ üôÉ
Quality video good but hindi language not available in many series and Japanese cartoons... So i give 2 star plz check this problem for next better update...@netflix
I can only give 4 stars because i have to pay even for the basic plan but overall it is a great app i have it on my tv and it has wonderful movies and wonderful picture quality so i highly recommend netflix although they could also give a free plan just like the old one
Always I didn't find the films that I love
Whats is wrong with netflix? My playback quality suddenly lowered to SD quality. My device clearly support full HD. (L1) I need to clear data and reinstall to restore the FHD quality. This thing happened on both my tablet and even on a flagship phone. Can you developers do a better job?
üëå
Can no longer find continue watching. App is getting worse every day.
Netflix putting ads in their shows has made the experience exponentially worse.

"App isn't opening, and payment has been done by auto-pay."
Very bad app
"New Review: As a Netflix user since 2017, I'm deeply dissapointed in their new password sharing charges, which is ridiculous. As a result, I'm canceling and moving on to another streaming platform due to their greediness. I will not miss Netflix nor will I return to give them a chance again. This sort of greediness is what'll drive all consumers out. I hope others realize what kind of a joke this is and cancel their subscription as well."
Best experience
Would really like the screen while watching shows on the app to be brighter. It darkens to where I can't watch anything properly.
"This is for cancelling 1899 season 2,i would even give negative if possible,you are just becoming more and more garbage time by time"
Best OTT Platform
"I have a request. Can you put a disclaimer on the beginnings of episodes when there's going to be something I have to read? Whether it be someone's text messages or random subtitles, it'd be much easier to know it's coming so I can stop cooking or doing the dishes for a sec. Like ""for those doing dishes while watch, about 12 min in you're gonna have to read something."" Thank you in advance"

"I cannot rate this higher despite the watch experience being decent. The most unintuitive and un-user friendly UI I have ever used, of all time. ""My List"" button is scattered everywhere. ""Continue watching"" and ""My List"" can sometimes go at the middle, most times below the suggested categories/shows that I do not want to browse. Buttons and ribbons incompetently placed against convention. Current show disappearing from the list once the last ep of the season ends."

Very bad at response to a customer mail. Still my problem is not solved. I already paid the amount of 199 ‚Çπ . But still is asking me to change the pay mode and re-pay again... I paid of this month amount but still i can't able see any of the movie.. now it's waste of money and my time. Either solve the problem r refund the money.! If u want any proof of my amount...do mail me *Netflix*.

Why is iOS Netflix look better than Android
So good tq
Netflix is faking history now? Cleopatra speaks for herself and doesn't need scholars to defend her. Netflix do some Google research before you make any documentaries it can help sometimes...
Too bad

I had to come to the reviews here to find out where to locate the show I'm currently watching in - app, because I forgot the name of it. Casting button sometimes appears, sometimes doesn't. Does anyone even use the games on Netflix? And the downloads could be kept in an area in the menu, not it's own tab. Really not a user friendly experiance."

I prefer add CC on movie cuz im deaf. I hope u can make for add CC please?
Please stop dubbing Asian shows with American accents ... might be fine for American audiences but for every other nation on the planet it sounds wrong and comes off as arrogant. There are many shows I'd like to watch but can't handle the terrible dubbing. (And sometimes subtitles are too difficult to follow being a bit dyslexic slow to read) ... surely it can't be that hard to find native speakers who can dub in English?

"this is a good app for watching movies and animes + more. I've been using Netflix since I was 7 or 8 I really recommend this app for watching movies and more, so try it out if u haven't! Some people might say Netflix isn't good but I'd say is awesome!"
"Hi, Netflix I hope this helps and credit me if this idea is possible. Given the idea of AI voice I think you can create voice caption where it uses the actual voice via AI to those videos problem is no voice actor can hire but the good thing is the voice still use the actual voice actor. So translation/caption in english or other languages are not needed. I guess this will be a phenomenal when it happens ü´∂üèΩ, sort of like improvement for captions something like that. That would be all üòÅ"

"This app is the most annoying thing that I have ever used in my life . I can't even use it if I don't update it , and after each update when I open the app I can't watch in HD anymore even though I paid for HD resolution because it says that my device is not HD compatible . So then I have to restart my device and re-install this app all over again ."
Still having old movies and no new updates..also I can't watch my favorite series like TMNT

"Netflix liked to cancel mostly serial movies and it is very annoying. Thats makes me hate to see ""NETFLIX ORIGINAL MOVIES"""
Ridiculous cultural appropriation all over their movies. It's disrespectful. Don't have a white role play a historically black person! And don't have a black role play a historically white person!
"They haven't added decent content in a couple years now. Unless you're getting the service free through your phone carrier, don't waste your money on it. The five star rating must be an employee or something, because the app is garbage now, and they don't care about their customers."
"Hello, is there going to be another season of Wakfu? It has been almost 3 years or has it already been 3 years?"

"Video is flickering going dark, only happening on this app. Not any other streaming apps on my phone, no issues with crave, amazon prime video, Disney+, YouTube, Plex. Incredibly frustrating"
Good app
Why can I not remove the app completely from my phone?
The movies and shows on here some times freezes for a few seconds sometimes more in the same video and sometimes skips a few seconds
"Pathetic app it's not working at all from last 15days it's just loading loading that's it i complained about it but still no action taken on that, I'm shocked y this Netflix has become so irresponsible with its service anyways good bye Netflix, waste to use Netflix i feel."

Works good
Shame that Netflix decides that wokeness is more important than the accurate portrayal of Egyptian culture in a DOCUMENTARY
"Hi, I am unable to download this app. Kindly assist"
Since Having to update the app there is now no chromecast icon so I literally have no way to watch Netflix except for on my phone. Some answers would be nice. Or a refund.
Amazing.nothing better.(my favorite streaming service/app)

Why can I not just look stuff up on the app??? When I click the search bar it brings up a list of options but I can't look it up. Horrible design.
I love it
2nd Best streaming app after youtube. Content could have better but technical wise it is only second to youtube
Nice

So I switch from apple to Android a week ago and the android I have is older but still 4glte however Netflix only shows a black screen. The menus are find but when I hit play on any show or movie no picture just sound. I followed the instructions found on Google to fix the issue and still not working ..
Please i want to play Netflix games Just free this games please üò≠üò≠üò≠
I WANT A SEASON 2 FOR BEE AND PUPPY CAT PLEASE
The app is not respoding after an update. Please look into it
"They keep making amazing first seasons of shows and then canceling despite season 1 setting up for other seasons. I'm sick of it, and frankly, it isn't worth the money anymore. They need to commit to the shows they make that do have a fan base instead of upsetting people by canceling. There are much better streaming services out there."
A great app

Bad and no useful app
This is for cancelling Lockwood & Co. just after one season.
Fake history about Egypt
I'm tired of watching shows only to have them canceled after 1 or 2 seasons. Especially when their good shows. Sci-fi fantasy don't stand a chance on Netflix
Go woke go broke
Good
This is very good and easy to use. Awesome
This is the best app for movies but they might have taken some of your favorite movies down because they had the movies on the app for so long
Amazing
Bring back super mario bros super show or I will never watch Netflix again
They became too woke.
Egypt is for Egyptians
very good
Egypt was built by the Egyptians
Cancelled
Como puedo seguir pagando mi cuenta enel Netflix?
Love it
"I got rid of my subscription because of their password sharing rules, when my neices tried to log in and use my account, rather than saying the account was canceled, Netflix just reactivated my account without even verifying. They don't protect anything, but their own profit"
"I like the app but I wish it could link to my TV Netflix, as in, picking movies and shows. It would make the app 4.8"
This useless app barely words.
Please don't delete the app if it's 1.0 I still watch in this app please don't delete it
"I love Netflix. I have cancelled my subscription at times because I am young and sometimes need to pay for more important things, but my favorite shows reside there: shameless, breaking bad, etc. I have no ads with my standard HD plan. It's easy to navigate. Hilarious that they have Netflix shorts (I don't watch them but I think it's nice to have a mini teaser/insight on the shows). I use this on my tablet and iPhone. Its admittedly better om my iPhone but doesn't make much of a difference."
I have travelled to some other place ...and it is not working ... As my family has recharge from atm card.. as it is connected with there atm card and my current location is not available to open it ... Why it is like is !?

Very Interesting Online Netflix Movie App ETC.
I have Netflix on my tv and it works no problem but the mobile version doesn't even get past the loading screen
Everyone should give it a 1 star until they start caring about what people want.
Netflix is racist and ignorant.

"Since updates and god knows what the hells been updated since they forever updating yet with every update comes more problems and im near giving up on netflix and going elsewhere, Pictures freeze constantly now with lags etc"
Imy priority choice really I like it
This app just just charged me 199 when I am no more subscribed.
This streaming platform is not worth it. The contents that they created are really stressing. They keep canceling series. #LockwoodandCo #SaveLockwoodandCo
Screen is very dim. Please fix

You should stop cultural appropriation.

Use to enjoy this.But the took almost all of Jeff Dunham gone. They took off Scooby-Doo movies. They took Criminal Minds out. They keep taking good stuff out. So not very happy with this app anymore. Not much fun. They made it hard to find what you want to see too.
Great

"I really use to like Netflix but EVERY time you come out with a really good Sci-fi/fantasy series, like Cursed for example, YOU CANCEL IT!! Why??? You make no sense. A lot of these series are rated #1, you get us captivated with them then for absolutely no reason at all cancel them. Do you not care about your viewers? The ones paying for service. Your personal feeling about the show should not matter, the ratings should. We should not have to keep being met with repeated disappointment."

"New updated version is suck. Whenever I open a movie, the control UI is corrupted, it seems like the UI was shifted to the left but I only able to tap on the area next to it for the function to work. The movie screen is also shifted the left. It's is not even in fullscreen mode. For context, I'm watching video on Youtube, Facebook, other streaming services without experiencing any similar issue."

"Hey Netflix, please add Dual Subtitles capabilities. In Asia, this will help multi generational families watch foreign content together. As an example, right now Korean drama fans can only choose either English or Mandarin subtitles but an aged parent may only be able to read mandarin subtitles but her grandchildren may only be able to follow English subtitles. Adding this will allow you to continue your leadership position and also something the government would look upon favorably."

Useless app
There are too many cancellations of shows!!! It's not worth watching something brand new and getting into it to hope for another season!! What's the point of liking a show anymore?
the fact that there is no retry payment button when all you care is about pricing is an absolute joke of the year.

There is more and more reason to stop watching Netflix. Netflix continues to cancel well-running series
Very bad application
Trash
I use to like Netflix but now there just as bad as cable they cancel every show I get into I'm starting to think it's time to delete my account with them since there isn't anything worth watching since it just gets canceled
This app would gain its place at the top only if they try to opt yearly subscription with a reasonable price.
Love it great app :) üôÇ

Racist content from racist developers ignoring history.

Needs Serious Improvement
Netflix is doing their viewers dirty by canceling most shows after 1 season because they aren't a huge hit right from the start like Stranger Things was. It is unfair to the shows cast and producers as well as the viewers.

Now you want to increase your prices. Damn you don't even have live streaming. HBOMAX and Disney Plus Cost less than NETFLIX. Talk about cutting the cable cord. Only for standalone companies to continuously increase their prices. Has barely any good African American movies. No title or episode number for the next episode.

Unbelievable.

"I have watched so many movies since I had surgery back in 08/2022. Netflix offers a lot of entertainment for the amount that you pay a month unless you are home for an extended amount of time. I'm sure many people found the new game of ""Movie Roulette"" while home during the high point of COVID. I happened to be an essential employee during COVID-19 outbreak. So at least I got to keep working. The roulette game is picking a movie by the picture that advertised it on the streaming service."

I have experienced not so good on this app. I have noticed a trend. I have noticed that most moves are like are taken away and They go to Free movie apps but they have commercial. Interruption. I don't like that. I'd like to see my movies. My favorite movies Without commercial interruption But it is now impossible because. My favorite movie's past And present my favorite movies seem to be moving to free apps and that's. Fair because I pay for Netflix
"The new update is downright stupid. Netflix where is my continue watching section, and where is my list? I don't care about what trending and top 10, I want to get back to my shows and movies without having to search for it each time. Way to make the user experience terrible."

The older version no longer works. Please allow the use of the previous version for subscribers to continue using an old Smart TV to connect to Netflix.
"Why does it keep in jumping when downloading, it just jumps to another set of movie"
Better than Amazon prime video but the weakest point is that netflix doesn't have many movies and they constantly remove them. I wanted to watch silence of the lambs. There's like the whole Hannibal series here except that one movie that I wanted to watch. Let's not talk about the fact that you can't adjust the quality of the video...terrible.
"If you watched the #netflix #trailer of #queencleopatra, one of the people they interviewed , who looks like they‚Äôre around 70 said ‚ÄúI remember my grandmother saying to me, I don‚Äôt care what they tell you in school, Cleopatra is black‚Äù so I was like ‚Äúwell that makes absolute sense why we got this nonsense‚Äù"

Glad I left. Rip off prices. Way better services elsewhere.
Forging history by putting black into everything. Shoving down our throats every possible LGBTQ propaganda and lobby agendas. Political correctness doesn't always equal correctness. They're driving the youth to normalize immorality regardless of the health and social consequences. Don't let your kids and teens watch Netflix
so bad

"So many shows to enjoy, but I do need to get is why shows are being removed from Netflix"
Egypt is here
I canceled my subscription and then they have tried a total of about 20 to 30 time to withdraw multiple different amount up to $28.
"After one of the last updates, i can't open the app. Just the netflix logo shows up, then nothing. On my laptop and tv, it works, just not on the phone. Please fix this!"
"The application is excellent but why remove some of the old movies? Examples like prison break, spatercus, and legend of the seeker. Etc."
Netflix killed my grandma... ok..
"Finally got Netflix again, cause there's been a lot of stuff on here I've been wanting to watch. Also, I forgot that there are now exclusive games with it, so that makes it even better. There's some really good ones! One thing I noticed, though, is on the ""More details"" section for games on the Netflix app, most of them say no controller support, even if the game does have it. For example, Dust and Neon has full controller support, but it says no for the details in the app."
Thank you Netflix
the best app ever!
There is nothing to watch lately
Bad

When will I get to see lookism season 2 If u the admin of the Netflix can't pass the papers ur waste to use i would never suggest anyone for your app just requesting u that pls bring lookism season 2 before 3 months because it's been 7 months already and yeah we are getting bored from your old shows ü§ßü§Æ
Very interesting
Why keep canceling good shows the midnight show was so good
Its a nice app tho watch movies

Shame on you
Just wow
They fake the Egyptian history
Just love this movie app
It's amazing but I think that they can't just keep cancelling the best shows eg: insatiable like bro I want SEASON 3 and euphoria I've never watched it but I think im speaking for a lot of people when I say that they should stop cancelling our favourite shows
Awsome
From the first day I started using Netflix I've been happy with it the only reason I'm giving it 4 stars instead of 5 stars is because some shows are abruptly canceled after only a few episodes which is annoying and some of my favorite series and movies aren't available although it may have to do with my region
Can't save to SD card on Samsung Galaxy s20
So bad experience documenting and giving wrong historical events Uninstalling the app
It's very amazing app
It's a good app but I feel like android's going to need more animations zoom in and out of the video and that's all I have to say
"Constantly takes movies and shows away just to replace them later. You'd think in this day and age they'd be able to hold millions of content without having to get rid of shows or movies you're currently watching. But they keep old movies that no one watches anymore smh Netflix, do better with how much you're charging and raising prices just foe nothing to be new. Might cancel and get prime video and hulu instead."
It's amazing but sometimes glitch so beware of that
Very bad

"I really hate the redesign they did of this app recently.

I ACTIVELY dont use Netflix as much anymore because navigating the app is so terrible."
"New user interface with no way to turn off autoplay trailer is really bad move. You cannot even see subtitle for some series if they have white scene, while some series have black bar for subtitle that makes up its clarity."
"Netflix likes to put out one season of a show that's awesome, then cancel it because it doesn't meet some random metric that they won't explain. A thousand garbage movies and shows and the good things they actually manage to produce get canned. The only thing Netflix is good for is wasting time trying to find something to watch, then realizing you need to go to another platform because they cancel the stuff that's actually interesting."

But for the most part, no matter what country I'm in, Netflix has alright content. Love a lot of Netflix originals, and the other shows & movies are great.-2017"

"Dude, stop removing shows üò≠ all the shows just disappear before I can watch it"

So far I haven't found any bugs but I really think that they should include network billing to support Telkom billing and other to make it more convenient and I think it will really get more people to use it because it's quicker and easier to understand and it can even help those who aren't able to make a membership plan and can buy it when they can but other then that it is so far in my opinion the best app to watch and stream your movies and series.
Whenever I try wait something it changes my brightness to lowest setting and I can't see a thing. If I try increase tue brightness again my phone tells me I can't as its being controlled by the app. Please fix this as currently unwatchable

"deep disappointment with Netflix's recent documentary on Cleopatra, The documentary portrays Cleopatra as a black African queen, despite the fact that there is no evidence to support this claim. In fact, most historians believe that Cleopatra was of Greek descent. The documentary also makes a number of other false claims about Cleopatra's life and reign. For example, it claims that she was a warrior queen who led her armies into battle. However, there is no evidence to support this claim either."

"Love the app however one suggestion there should be a comment session for every episode, it might be fun."
Since last few months my screen goes black and only audio can be heard every few days on my samsung phone. Netflix works fine on TV and samsung Tab. My phone hangs and is stuck as a blank screen with audio running when this occurs. No other action but holding down the power off button for a long time works. Some said this is due to app needing update or disabling accessibility so I did all that. But it comes back in a few days even if the app auto-updates. It is a very frustrating experience.

Great
"This new interface design of Netflix mobile app is beyond worst. They wanted to make it like other social media Instagram or Snapchat or something I absolutely don't know. But an ott platform's interface shouldn't be like this. It's a big flaw of the developer or whoever thought to make it that way. Please change it as soon as possible and make the interface design to the old and develop on that only, but this is what it is now it beyond worst. It feels like a black colour Snapchat app."
I'm having problems with my netflix the app is not opening please deal with this problem quickly
Why i can't open? The netflix
No English subtitles for demon slayer season 3 episode 5
It takes me from a to b so I like it
Great....
Loru
Awesome
Very good
"Bad releases I am watching demon slayer every week waiting for the new episode,, last episode was blurry when released and the episode now does not even have subtitles,, My plan is the most expensive one and this service is not it"
On this app you can really enjoy it and also the customer service is on time to help...
It's fantastic and good
"It is hanging my whole phone when I press play on anything. At first I thought my phone has an issue ,but everything else works fine until I play anything on netflix"
Worst streaming app experience I have ever had. Today only they dropped the 5th episode of demon slayer but how can I watch it because THERE IS NO SUBTITLES AT ALL üò°üò° FU......ING IRRITATING.
This app has the worst brightness setting that is always making your screen flip out.
i can't change plan...

"Should you not provide a free watching with ads like YouTube and Spotify, that way you could have more user."
Thank you for thinking of us.

I like netflix
Nice one
A friend's also had it
A very good app to use when watching a movie
Bsd
Great
Not even close and personal
This was a great app for the most part but I always had issues with the pause/play/progress bar menu disappearing. Now that menu disappears the majority of the time making it impossible to start and stop and pause a show once started. Closing and reopening the app a bunch of times sometimes works but very inconsistently.
Ucgh
I like it Netflix app
Please please please please please please please

"Netflix has been steadily declining but it is still a good streaming service, still got HEAPS of good movies and shows. I just wish their catalog wasn't getting quietly trimmed of all the best stuff or if not outright removal they're limited to certain countries."
bad
I love Netflix AHHHH
I LOVE IT SO VERY MUCH
I can't cast to my tv from the app which is dumb as heck
it oh ok
So far Netflix is great
Why does the widevine level keeps changing to L3 when I'm using my Samsung Tab S8+? The only fix i have is uninstall/install the app which is frustrating. Please fix this.
"Good App but has limited options to like or unlike a movie... If a movie is very bad they don't have the option to say that, just to say if you like the genre... The genre is OK but the movie is too bad... Like Luther and other movies..."

I don't like Netflix anymore because they are getting rid of The Host Club and that is my favorite show.

The best app.
This app is so bad üòû
"Please allow us to change the resolution for this app, on wifi, i cannot change it"
Great app for movie lover like me
This app is much more amazing...

i like it a lot - Little pea
"Does NOT allow VPN nor does it ever deliver 4K. Also, no more direct user control over app performance. Huge % of Netflix programs are not fit nor healthy to consume - uplifting programs usually get canceled or become so PC they become depressing and unwatchable."
its cool i love netflix but it takes a while to download
Been a long time costumer. Satisfied with the userface. Very simple to use. Thanks Netflix. Chris
Doesn't work anymore crashes and stops frequently honestly Amazon prime doesn't have these issues Netflix has to many bugs I usto love Netflix until now
"I have never seen a search stupid app in my life don't even wast your time to download it cause, I tried to open it and it refused search bad"

"doesn't rate their series with the proper sexuality warning, not everyone's willing to expose our children to woke agenda üòê canceled my subscription"
Very useless aap ...wate for money... Never get newly released episode
Least app
Demon slayer episodes are not coming on time !!!
My tv lags everytime it uses Netflix. Hulu. Hbo. Amazon. Funimation they work perfectly fine. It's just Netflix that messes up. No point having Netflix on my tv if it does work properly.
"I bought the membership yesterday and the money was deducted from my account, after sign up, I was not able to play a single video on Netflix, It was keep saying me to update payment method, When I tried to update my payment method, it was asking me to PAY AGAIN for the same subscription, why would I pay again that I have already paid, When I cancelled my subscription, I got no refund"

"I might watch movies all day long. But movies on Netflix keep on rebuffing ang lagging from time to time on movies. Is there an update for this? How can I fix this? Or could It be my Netgear N600 3700 wireless router. The price for standard plan is going up on Netflix Account up on the bill to $15.00 in March. I do not know much longer I will be able to pay the Netflix bill. ""Lower your prices""! It would be nice to have a option to have a discount with the Illinois Link Card."

Worrest service just five minutes back I did recharge amount debited from my account but showing screen update payment? Costemer service is -000000 They are saying amount we will be send in 8 working days And they are saying go safe. Don't use Netflix my dear friends
These days the UI part is not that good.

Thieves of history falsifying Egyptian history

Why does it keep telling me incorrect password for what I'm sure is right?

Very nice
"The reason I'm rating this app 2 stars is because, in the UK there's not many good shows and all the good shows are in America and you have to be in America to watch them on Netflix, why can't you just allow everyone to watch the same thing like, legacies still isn't on Netflix in the uk (England), I don't think it's fair, if you could put more American TV shows I'll change my rating."
I love this apo
"Whenever watching a native English speaking movie or show and there is a scene in a foreign language, Netflix does not display the subtitles. It makes it impossible to follow quite often leaving the only option to simply switch off. So many people have been complaining about this issue for over 9 years and it still remains. PATHETIC"
Ddd
"The fact that you STILL had to make a whole stupid subscription for two people to watch Netflix under the same account is honestly the most retarded idea ever. I love how you had a whole pandemic to get loads of money from people staying home on your app, and YOU STILL do this dumb mess. Really puts a shame to Hulu's ads every 5 minutes in any episode. I'd rather pay 5.99 a month to watch a parrot on ecstasy sing. Your subscription for two screens is literally Youtube's ad removal subscription.."
"Edit: now I can't even change it back from L3 anymore with any of the troubleshooting tips. Avoid the mobile app like the plague! Original: The app keeps changing the Widevine from L1 to L3, which means I'm only able to play in SD quality without HDR. The only fix for this is to reinstall it. And this happens frequently... It's extremely frustrating to say the least."

I dont why I am unable to open the app it's just freezing and I alresdy have a Netflix account
I can't purchase subscription using prepaid come one pls I want to buy using prepaid broüòì
Since the update the cast icon fails to appear despite being able to cast Stan and Disney+ from the same device. Netflix is useless to me without the ability to cast to my TV. Going to cancel my subscription if this isn't resolved soon :(
Quite ok but hard to navigate. It would be useful to have a sign on the items I have watched already because they are mixed in with everything else currently in the different categories

"Love Netflix ,I love it I won't lie it is easy to use and many genres to come by but when I download episodes and try watching it on a trip or by a place with no network the movie begins lagging on random parts of the movie hope you can fix this."

I had always loved netflix but all I do now is waste data by downloading shows that won't play. The app does not work but my money pays for the service.
Good
I love it!
Very bachood aap
"Too expensive compared with other 4k streaming services P+, D+ and Prime, if Netflix knocked ¬£5-10 off to bring it in line with the competition, I would consider adding it to my other subscriptions."

Netflix is falsifying history and dishonestly supports blackwashing ancient Egyptian history
Netflix team- Humble Request - Don't bring in advertisements to bring in more revenue. Maintain the same standard and cost if possible without irritating ads. Just improve and focus only on content. Need not focus too much on Indian languages though good films can be motivated. Irrespective of language maintain content quality. Loyal and genuine subscribers must be enough.
"I love this app there is this one season called outerbanks and I wish that they could keep it alive and out there on Netflix please because I want to watch it over and over again it was perfect, amazing, and brilliant I bet I could keep saying this stuff but just tell the people who made it to keep up the good work it's a really amazing season Im just so mind blown and btw can u pls tell them my message and Netflix has a whole tons of shows that's so good but thank y'all for keeping up the good"

Pretty much all the new movies are dubbed and from other countries. None from America. Absolutely rubbish
Streams with a colour tint over some shows which cannot be fixed when using my phone. When watching directly via the tv quality drops to 240p with no options to change stream quality. Their website straight lies about this and the cause of the hue trying to blame customers for their poor product.
i really like this app cuz of this app u could watch more things which are intersting in ur personnal life üòçüòç

They don't let you search what you want. They only show you what the homosexuals that work at Netflix want you to see.
U search a movie... Currently we dont have this ... We dont have that... So many classic movies are not available...

"The filthiest agenda ever introduced to mankind. Starting from spreading nudity and normalizing homosexuality, falsifying history, spreading anti-religious ideas, questioning the unity of God, to sympathizing with Satan, and brainwashing the whole world with toxic ideas. And all this under the banner of freedom of thought and creativity?! Is thought and creativity limited to nothing but daubing poison in honey?! Shame on you deceivers"
They've removed tons of good TV shows and movies. Stop removing content. U also can't see what they have before paying for it and IMO they're way too expensive. And there is no option for 1080HD with 1 screen and no ads. IMO that shouldn't be more than 10/mo.

Too expensive
It's a great app but once you watch alot of things it gets boring and they keep removing all the good movies leaving you with the bad ones.
"My review is also the same as others who rated 1 star, yes it's about the ""freezing videos"" from downloaded movies, To be honest it works better on laptops and TV's but on mobile it is not. Even tho while watching online from mobile the video is getting struck can't say buffering."

Stop using the synopsis section to glorify your cast & directors! It's already in the small print & credits if I want it. I'm sick of having to Google movies cause I've no idea what they are about!!!
It refuses to open ....and sometimes does not allow downloading to watch when I'm offline

"it's a very nice app, but the only problem is that they don't have alot of new movies I'm looking for"
The new account sharing rules are ridiculous. Youre going to lose loads of subscribers. Hald of the content isnt worth paying for and the other half is old and outdated. There are many streaming services now and Netflix are getting too big for their boots.
"After so many years of having access to one of the few descent streaming apps that didn't have adds, this recent development has been one huge step backward. It really is insane to me, the extra garbage we have to deal with makes it no better than other apps like it, and with that, there are just better options out there. I hope enough people reconsider paying to use netflix to the point where you reconsider the changes made and we can go back to the good times."

Nice app
"Bad company, worse app. Netflix has gone down this bad racist route of blackwashing history and replacing historical figures in documentaries with black actors, most notably Cleopatra and Anne Boleyn, neither of which were black. While this is a bad move, the apps performance is even worse, constantly buggy and poor performing, Chromecast support is terrible, I have a 1Gbps connection yet the app is constantly buffering and struggling to load while the browser on PC works fine"
Bad app and service
Good content with proper clarity
"[Love how using a LONG outdated iOS version of this app is a much better experience than the latest Android version... Leaving and reentering the app mid episode restarts it, trying to fast forward or rewind by increment too many times breaks the player, the UI in general is worse and feels bloated. Oh and apparently they did a TikTok as well like YouTube before them.] Edit: Ok, it looks like they fixed it. Impressive. Game ads are a little dumb though."

Harder to find your own list hidden away in your profile, why have a list? Explore doesn't work as main focus for all interaction even linguistically, dont know ehat they were thinking. Go back to drawing board."
Great
"Now, the app won't let me use chromecast. I followed all the directions given to me by someone with the help center, and it still isn't working. All my other streaming apps will let me chromecast from my phone to the chromecast connected to my TV but not Netflix. That was the main way I watched/used Netflix, so now Netflix is kinda null for me. Would much rather want to use disney+ or hulu."

Prior to the last update app was on point. Now casting to chromecast only sometimes works (works fine in all other apps) Design layout is frustrating as the top and bottom of the screen occasionally cuts off making it difficult to switch between seasons for shows. Overall it's pretty poor for a paid service.

"""Updating prices to bring you more"".... you don't have a great selection, your shows are full of its own subliminal advertising, and none of the shows helps expand the minds of viewers- just distractions and programming.

"I have always enjoyed the movies from Netflix, as I've had them since 2013, and I've ALWSYS been satisfied. I enjoy Netflix, because there are so many choices, in what you want to watch, drama, comedy, Syfy, it doesn't matter, never a full day, with Netflix. The only thing I don't like, is the going up of prices,as when I first became a NETFLIX customer, I remember it was only 7.99 a month, now, for the same thing, it's 16.00 a month, that's a increase of 8.00, that's DOUBLE. The cost of living."
I was good even I love watching flash
my experiance was good except i had a hard time choosing shows that i liked and that were my style i know that not everyone had this problem! Overall i pretty much liked it. but my kids also couldet find shows that they liked my 8 year old aubrynn has her hair dyed pink and loved the gymnastics shows and wished there were more that she like!
Good app.. but few glitches. It controls my phone brightness? And theres no way to turn it OFF..?
Bad
I can watch every movie
Very bad

"I can't believe what you did. Do you really not know about ancient Egypt? Oh my God. You must have information about these things. How did you know that Cleopatra was black? Can you convince me because I did not expect this for a famous site like you, Egypt for Egyptians Gentlemen."
Hi im struggling to download this app now i can't watch anything on my phone.
"I used to pay for 4 family members who would use it occasionally, but with the new restictions on account sharing with separate houses, the cost would be far to much for just one user rarely watching the same 2 shows, that are other platforms without the restriction. Was cheaper to buy the physical copies of the shows than pay for the service. Also the app has slowed drasticaly from what it used to be (on my main media device). The restrictions are mostly the final nail in the proverbial coffin."
I started watching Breaking Bad and this spinoff of Better Call Saul. I have watched it for 6 seasons now. I have a lot of tv shows and movies that keep me entertained. My only complaint is when certain things are permanently removed.
It's nice
Love ‚ù§
Great
i want this app to come in full meaning
"After recent update, the app is not working on my galaxy tablet A. It works well with TV or the phone but we use tablet to watch. Tried reinstalling, does not fix the problem. Please look into this, looks like I'm not the only one."
Amazing it soooo good hope it's good for u
I like it
"In general - it's an ok app. But missing Cast icon is just killing me. I don't want to login to my Netflix account on every TV. I travel pretty often but I want to watch my Netflix on the TV wherever I stay... The cast icon should be there (with my premium account) but it is not... So I can cast my phone screen via Google home app (but then I can't use my phone for anything else while watching Netflix), but I can NOT do it natively in the Netflix app. Unreasonable and irrational."
The civilization is 100% Egyptian
Since the last update it's become impossible to watch anything anymore it's just black screen with sound... really starting to wonder why I still pay for this...
great
I like this app because it has the new Dahmer television series! Other apps don't have it. I think everybody likes Netflix for the most part.
Excellent
"The latest update is one of the worst I've ever seen in any app. I honestly have no idea what's the mindset behind that design decision, but obviously, the team that designed and approved that decision possibly don't even watch Netflix. Another issue is that the cast feature is possibly broken as the cast icon does not appear unless I play a YouTube video, disconnect and then open Netflix. It's been 4 days since it started... Coincides with the update."
It's good but you have to pay so much money just for an app.i can't believe it.so 1 stars
Is a good app
You are a disgrace to get rid of the lgbtq community I'm done with this

"They Support cheating &lying ""Cleopatra movie "" Egyptian not black üëéüëéüëéüëéüëé"
"Useless, pointless update. The main screen now is just full of recommendations not what you watched recently. My memories sometimes so bad I cant remember what I watched so would have to search it. Change it netflix, we pay enough."
"My app is booting me out even tho there are only 2 users online. I've tried to update, problem still persists. I'm very annoyed as I'm paying and I can't even view on my own phone! If this continues I will be cancelling my Netflix account!"
Really really really really very very very good
Latest update is completely not user friendly. Where is continue watching and your list? Removed from homepage and now hidden under search? Who cares about 'what everyone's watching' and 'coming soon'? More of Netflix trying to force their shows on you. Terrible
Changing historical facts
Idk if there is a reasson but i think all shows should be on all versions on netflix. Im using Netflix ireland and i dont have access to shows like family guy..
very good
I love Netflix love it I've been a member since 2018
"egypt for Egyptians, Cleopatra wasn't black , ancient Egyptians weren't black , this is the fact !! your movie no body will watch it because it's liying Cleopatra was white women"

Netflix need to fix their app why can i not download a movie to my phone when I paid already I can only watch
Terrible UI. No language filters. Not recommend for Tamil movie fans. Not much Tamil movie available.
Horrible

"The mobile app should provide a more comprehensive quality selection. The auto, max, and data saver are imprecise and do not let me change quality while playing a video in video player. Most other OTT platforms allow you to select quality in an easily accessible location. I don't see why netflix can not do the same. Alongside a quality selection option(SD, HD, FullHD,4K), I also get that annoying 5.10 bug when I switch between cruncyroll and netflix. Fix it."

"Seems like can't use Netflix if we are traveling to a different country on vacation or moving out due location based block by Netflix without canceling the original plan on the home country initial subscription made, and we are losing the subscription fee for that month for nothing worst move by Netflix if they can identify the device that initially signed on why adding restriction. regardless of location,your service should work as you guys can identify the existing and new devices"
amazing
"Some stuff gets removed and then readded while others just stay gone, while they add other ""useless"" stuff. Happy tree friends is gone in my location now, idk about others. Some stuff isn't available per location or profile. Exp; I found an anime on one profile but not mine and yet I'm checking in the same location. Need more eng dubbed anime, I started watching eng dubbed anime when I was younger and now I can barely find any new end dubbed anime that I haven't seen on here."

New update is used to push shows that I have never been interested in nor do they conform to what i usually watch. Finding my list or continue watching is not convenient at all. That should be the first thing I see
Still I can't able to open Netflix. When I used to open the app it shows Netflix and then stuck.
Most of anime doesn't have english language option
Worst app ever
The new display format sucks hard.

This application is very bad because it conveys the history of Egypt and Egyptians to black Africans in general. I do not support it

Cool
"""I have mixed feelings about Netflix. On the one hand, I appreciate the company's efforts to promote diverse and inclusive storytelling by producing Afrocentric content. As a supporter of racial equality, I believe that everyone deserves to see themselves represented on screen. On the other hand, I am disappointed that Netflix seems to overlook or misrepresent other cultures, such as Egyptian history. As an Egyptian myself, I would love to see more accurate and respectful depictions of my herit"

"Netflix is very meh, it has some good content, but alot of it is very poor. The most annoying feature is when you search for films and it pops up, and when you go onto the title it usually tells you they dont have it, if they dont have it, dont show it on the search list."
I am sick of Netflix claiming that there are so many episodes when they are not available. If I wanted to watch a weekly show I would stick to cable TV!
Bad appüí©
"Netflix is very good in it's service but I have 2 problems with it , first is that when I use the next episode button it shows that I didn't watch the episode that I just watched. Second is that there is not many anime in Netflix , i need more anime."

"Hey,Netflix ! you are really really amazing,but I am disappointed about one thing. The thing is that the ""Peaky Blinders"" series is so popular in India and it has a huge fan base in India. Still you are not streaming it in Hindi. I have a request to you please do ""Peaky Blinders"" Hindi dubbing and stream as soon as possible. Hope you will give due attention to this matter. A user."
Netflix's watch I watch things on And I love it justifies it won't accept my and it's not boring and I need somebody to come help me set it up I need don't want to do it so I wish I could do it what is getting difficult call help center won't help then I come in where I live and they are especially their busines there's something I hate I need to call the Netflix password keep I know like you to tell me some more I need help help me and tell me more what you have what do you have I need to call

"Cant use it anywhere besides at your home, not even on vacations or trips, unless you pay more."
"It is good, but after watching a movie you have 5 - 10 seconds to enjoy the credit music, then a random preview start and has a completely different genre..... On Amazon Prime you get to enjoy the credit music, wind down and enjoy the credits..... Mamma Mia credits stopping after 10 seconds completely kills the final experience.... Amazon knows people like watching the credits with the music."
I make 1 star because the new film that is about cleopatra
Very bad experience
Thanks for making me have to burrow through junk to find what I am currently watching. Cheers! We all love that!
Apparently the developers are not smart enough to allow you to manage your own account using the application. You have to use the website to update your payment information... Who wants to do that??? Fix your application! If I could give a 0 start rating I would....

"Netflix's Chromecast support has always been something to laugh at, not sure how difficult it might be to implement the feature right, but I think it SHOULD NOT be this painful... Anyhow, it is what it is. All my other streaming services, and Google Home, are casting perfectly to my device, but netflix isn't. I already tried everything in Netflix's troubleshooting page (reboot device, reboot chromecast, etc.), I guess I'll just way until another day when it finally decides to work again."

Keeps removing cool childhood movies and other amazing series and adds stupid LGBTQ content

Using Netflix has really saved me the stress of having to search out ways to watch movies..It's basically Unlimited Entertainment anytime anyday with Netflix.
"Time to leave netflix, it has 99.9 % soap opera shows. Nothing for men to watch anymore, who wants to watch love making shows all the time? Not me talk about soap opera central.

A lot of amazing things on it

Netflix used to be good. Now the smart tv app is clunky and difficult to navigate. Autoplay while in preview is a pain. Exiting the app requires too many clicks. As far as the content goes there are far too many series that are cancelled after one or two seasons.
"Impossible to get it to cast video with google chrome, my other apps such as Disney work fine..."
Expensive subscription and yet sub-par content.

"I have not used the app for quite some time since I am quite a busy person. It's not related about the functions and UI perspective but rather the automatic deduction of my money without my permission. Netflix just process my last money and I am not happy about it.

"So when I try and watch Netflix on my Roku TV, either the screen freezers or the sounds don't line up what on the screen. Sometimes, I have to reboot my TV just to watch Netflix.

Every time I create an account. Netflix always wants me to enter a phone number. Then say WE SEND A TEXT. When I go on any gmail or contacts to see if they send the text to me. The text is not there. Every I create an account they want me to choose a plan and all 3 plans are never free. I have to pay for them with a debit or credit card to get them and my debit or credit cards are invalid and they don't let me in.

"Excellent earlier but now a days worst series are coming like Rana Naidu which was worst series. It contains worst seens. If it avoids such a web series, then Netflix became no 1"

Why have you hidden 'continue watching in your latest interface? It seems to be forever forgotten in your UX & is most important for many. Why alsi do you need 2 buttons for Games which instead one of them could be 'MyWatching'. I understand you want to promote new content but you are forgetting basic viewing needs.

Bad
It's just a good app mate
"They said today would have been season 2 for demon slayer but they lied , it didbt come out."
I hate that they put only one or two movies of a trilogy like if i wanna watch shreck i want ALL of the movies not just 1 or 2

"I did not even update to the newest version after reading about UI change I wouldn't like, however, up until now I've been updating regularly and yet, throughout all those updates, I continue to have the same major issue...The app randomly stopping my show and changing to either the previous episode or entirely different season. Sometimes it happens only once, and sometimes many times in a row after me trying to go back watching my current episode it'll change again. Incredibly frustrating..."

"I have the premium plan, however my diagnostic says my maximum stream resolution is SD (Which is 480p, not even 720p.) I'm trying to watch minimum 1080p and the quality is unacceptable."
Nice app
Egypt for Egyptians only!!
One of the worst app in this whole world . I recommend to never use it

"Since this most recent update, Netflix has become a problem. Everytime I try to watch a movie I get kicked back to home page. I don't know what to do to fix it. Never had a y problems before the April update."
When I try to download movies it refuse

Disgusting company...

"Ribet bgt mau ganti resolusi. Kenapa ngk kayak youtube aja sih simple, bisa ganti resolusi di dalem video"
New episode of Anime upload Delay every time and some time subtitles are not available. As a otaku i pramote anime by watching it only legal platform By paid subscription and then these services provider theses this kind of things.
The recent update on the app makes it horrible. Not user friendly . . Hate it to the core. I just wanna cancel netflix because of this nonsense.
please put report subtitles on the list. the one that im watching right now is delayed subs (ranking of king)
There's a lot of show variety which is good but it takes too long to find a show you're in the mood to watch at any given time. I suggest that you include some kind of search by tags method with which you can search for shows that align with multiple tags.
If I wanted adds I would watch YouTube or real TV what's the point of paying for no adds if I'm getting adds
There should be a recharge for Only tv and pc
I giving one star because am from ap In this OTP only new Telugu tv show
Nothing from it it not working?
Garbage!!
It works if you're not using the chromecast So just accept the fact that you have to watch it on your phone
Why do I have to watch adds while I am paying for this service?
Good and excellent üòä

"Excellent selection of content, automated collection of money without my permission. Add a pay now button and stop the automated collection of money not everyone can afford to spare.

Wonderfull
When I turned on smart download . Its downloaded same movie in 3 different language. It's really disappointed...
Why so delay of releasing of anime?? Other plat form they can release why netflix so delay?

For sailor moon series dubs please make it the Studiopolis dub version. Also can there a free month trial because I recommend this with my friends but they're not sure to try it

Better for intertwine
"You need to seriously listen to your users. Simply terrible. Constantly crashing my s22 ultra and forces restart (3 times in one day). Kicks me out and forces me to re-sign in, then tells me my information is incorrect. App crashes half the time when using PiP. I've had nothing but problems with Netflix this year. How has Hulu overtaken you in performance, usability and selection?? What a joke."
I just want to watch my movies
Bad app
Super eww app
Bruhh I don't know what is my password of email bruhhhhhh
"New update horrible. Unable to cast which means unable to watch anything. About to cancel Netflix, this is the last straw."
Very good experience with next
Stuck in SD format on S23 Ultra. I see that they're others who are experiencing the same thing.
"What have you done to the app homescreen? What users mainly want when they open the app is to continue with shows they've started. Right now we can't see that. I'm not interested in what everyone else is watching now. THAT should be on a submenu, not the first thing everyone sees."
This App Sucks Don't be Fool To this App You need to pay To watch worst App ever ü§Æü§Æü§Æü§Æü§Æü§Æ

"Stop faking the Egyptian history !!! Why should I see my culture be presented by American people who don't know anything about the history . If you just go to google, you will know cleopatra was Greek!! And the funny part is that they rudely say that this is a documentary and this is really how cleopatra looked . How ignorant you are !!! I am Egyptian and saying that this is not my history. stop faking everything just to share your stupid ideas . We are Egyptians. We have the right to say no."
"Works well but it skips like an old cd, when you have had it for years and the kids got a hold of it and it don't play no more. I have missed full episodes due to the skipping."
Absolute trash!!! There are no good shows on UK broadband I recently travelled to another country and there were so many good series on there for half the price of UK
I love how you can download episodes and watch them while offline and all of the good series/movies
It's the worst. I wish I hadn't used it. It's the worst app in the galaxy. I wish it would disappear. I put one star to be able to express my opinion

"An application for a platform that falsifies history and broadcasts many acts forbidden by God, such as homosexual scenes, and the platform also supports the African movement with documentaries that carry a lot of forgery in historically proven facts, the latest of which is the movie ‚ÄúCleopatra‚Äù starring a black-skinned woman even though Cleopatra descends from a white-skinned Macedonian dynasty, It is documented on the walls of Egyptian temples that the rulers of ancient Egypt were not Africans"
Good
So wonderful.
"I have been watching Netflix for a few years and some of the updates are good. I just noticed, wish there was a way to know if I have seen a movie before besides the thumb upside or down. I just want to see the same one ifi have seen it already."
I love it!!

You know the lorax and how Mr. O'Hare somehow got threatened by a tree?He is short but a tree threatened?????oh and are the worker of O'hares business getting paid?I have so many questions
New update makes finding recently watched stuff not appear! They just want you to watch whatever they are pushing on you. Why do I have to go to search to find what I was watching when the tv app just shows the recently watched stuff? Don't update your app if it was working fine before
Good
I like it
Ok love watching demon slayer just incredible
Good app but the data is much
Someone is using it under my name. Have tried everything to stop them. A year and a half and still going.
I hate how someone logs in
I don't recommend this terrible app.
Need more new shows
It's ok for a small subscription. Just.queen cleopatra is a joke bty
"Honestly everytime it just closes on me, it's still open but is constantly closing. It was fine when I first installed it but now. It's just being incredibly annoying and I can't even watch what I want, and even if it does work and I get to the show I want to watch it just shutdowns and says nothing about the problem. 1 star terrible app, fix this please."

"I love to use the app to watch anime and other stuff. And 1 problem I would love to watch all of demon slayer on Netflix but instead I had to go to hulu to finish it, but Netflix does a good job on keeping up with one piece, tho I still have not finished one piece, and I like the tik tok kind of thing when I use my phone to watch Netflix. üòä"

Netflix I am strongly recommending you to add rupay payment method for india.
Ok ra gud hahaha

"I just started, then it begins well."
Coz this company is lying ü§• and faking the history How come queen Cleopatra had black skin and she was from Greek ü§£ü§£ü§£ If you want to create a stroy while hiring a black skin actress create one about great character - real black skin one- don't fake it. We are not dumb!!!!
Great
Casting does not work after the latest update. Also the new UI is so horrible I am giving up on Netflix alltogether
My app does not open even after the upgrade
Can you add Star over option to the series ...cuz some times when watching reruns it just skips the episodes...since we have seen it already...! That might be really helpful. Thank you.
"Why can't Netflix provide an easy option to change/upgrade your plan? It's so annoying and disappointing that you just assume I would always and forever use the same plan I started with, I contacted a Netflix personnel, nothing changed, it wasn't even helpful at all. Asides this and the fact that there are many incomplete but interesting series, I think it's okay."
Very bad app support rasicem
They create misleading and forged documentaries that have nothing to do with true history
There is a missing feature that is screen rotation for Landscape and portrait.
üç∏
Not worth the price
this app (netflix) contains audio description how audio description works : audio description reads anything on the tv were the person do some scenes or actions (e.g. eat a steak or a man sitting on a table)
Source of full entertainment. Nice print and above all uninterrupted movies.
"Took off Norbit, Winx Club seasons, Pop Pixie and Minecraft Story mode."
"Netflix used to have amazing shows but they all got canceled. Canceling the warrior nun and going back on what they said in 2017 about encouraging password sharing only to go back on that has made me happily cancel this downward spiral of a streaming service... I'm done with it... even if they do come out with something worth watching, Netflix has garnished the reputation of canceling good shows and I wouldn't want to get my hopes up... bye Netflix you used to be good..."

i dont have time to describ my experience but i like itüëç
Awesome
When it first appears on the screen it says FREE. But who I begin to apply then I see a PRICE to have the app installed.
They should stop shoving tiktok features and just focus on being good at streaming and browsing around
Please dub all kdramas in english or hindi
Excellent
omg it is the best streaming app
"Used to be a satisfied customer , yet after your new greedy policy I had to cancel. Btw I have never shared my account with anyone."

"Cleopatra was black??? ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£ Why is Netflix determined to produce a series that presents a false version of history?, for instance, by depicting Cleopatra as black? It seems to me that they could opt to make a movie about George Bush and enlist Kevin Hart to portray himü§£ü§£"

I'm not sure why but when I watch a video the screen flickers..not even once but continuously from the beginning and end of the video I watch..in fact I also have problems downloading the video..for some reason when I download at the beginning the speed is good and fast I can get internet...but after a few minutes it stops downloading for no apparent reason...even if I use a strong network it's still the same...I hope you can solve this problem as soon as possible
Does as should

"Today, my Netflix doesn't work. I wonder why?????? 4/29/33 Netflix HAS removed ALL FAITH/ CRISTIAN categories from their platform. I had a very interesting conversation with one of their customer service reps, she could not tell my why this company removed that category all together. This is sad. They have no tolerance for anything Christian. Not worth my money for ANY STREAMING SERVICE."

I like this Apps because we can watch any type of movie that we want to watch
So bad
"2r;~3‚ñ™Ô∏é~~\,\ W"
I hate the new update.And I am watching a show and it has five seasons but it only show 3
"A rubbish app that does not deserve a star... It should be downloaded at all, and I do not advise anyone to download it ...and their films are all lies and thefts (Egypt for Egyptians)"
"Don't like the new layout. Also, when I click to cast my phone to my tv, it clicks on the menu to choose a category to watch. Really annoying"
Good
"Does not work on tablet anymore. I have no idea why, just now states that this app won't work for my device. I can't even find it in the playstore anymore. I have no clue what's going on but I would hope they fix this. All my software is up to date too."
Letest update is very üòûüòûüòû
"Netflix is absolutely good,no wahala with it"
I haven't started a membership yet I wish you could upgrade the app so we could use opay and palmpay to pay for membership
Looks like a wonderful app can't wait to enjoy it have company coming in for the next two weeks from out of state I think everybody in the household will enjoy better than watching regular TV and listening to the news all the time which can be very bad thank you
Stealing culture of Egypt
Sucks
I'm so much happier with Nexflex enjoy all the movies that's my optional.
Brightness minimum level is absolutely too high
"April 28th update has broken the Chromecast option on Netflix app on Android device . Need to be fixed, thanks"
I am getting distorted videos. I tried to unistall it but still experiencing the same. Please fix this because I am paying for something that I cannot enjoy.
Put Dora the explorer on Netflix
You guys are the best
Very bad
"Awful UI update, why would new shows be in ""home"", and shows you were already watching be under ""explore"" makes no sense and makes the app feel like its made for people with zero attention span or self reliance"

"It was good in 2015, but when they released Cuties I could see the hill they were heading down and I haven't regretted cancelling since. I caught The Diplomat at a friend's place and that one was good."
My whole family has always used Netflix and always will my mom's favorite n mine
For the shame of the so-called Queen Cleopatra movie and the falsification of history.. Netflix is ‚Äã‚Äãa platform that adopts forgery.
The date keeps changing in like the movie and stuff from I can be heros it was released in 2021...
Y'all cancelled some of my favorite shows and then keep make more trash
I can't sign in
Pls why Is the new update on spoken subtitles not working on my Samsung? Is it for iPhone users only?
Everything needs English option..one way or the other. More HORROR MOVIES!!!!!
Netflix wants to trade in Egyptian history for its personal interests.it wants to steal history and change it. The pharaohs are not Africans . The Africans have their own civilization. The Egyptian civilization belongs to Egyptains only. Do not falsify history. Stop stealing our history.
Deliberately blocks playback when casting to projectors (like mogo)
Your app is so bad it gives the worst graphics possible it use to be amazing and full screen and now you greedy people ruined it
Love it so much

"It is very monstrous and must be wiped out because it insults the Egyptians and the Egyptian civilization, and this is the civilization of the Egyptians, and everything in Egypt belongs to us, and there is nothing in our country that belongs to the black Africans. There is nothing to prove that antiquities do not belong to us and belong to strange people, you liars, and you are not right, and the black groups are liars, and you know that the Egyptians are black, and we are white in skin, and you"

Good streaming platform. Need to add more games.
This application is the underrated app üëé
"This new update and interface basically ruined the ease of use of the service, it's so trash and doesn't serve to make content easy to locate like the old layout. Much better to just watch on a web app or tv instead of this mindless garbage on mobile."
Very very nice app

I hate this app 1/10
Woke propaganda & racist
"Update is terrible, other people explained exactly why, stop taking God shows off in suspending them. The app keeps saying it is not responding every single time I get on and it does not stop until I delete the app again! This is happening on multiple devices it isn't just a software issue"
"I can't watch movie in Samsung tab s8. The video always stops after few seconds and takes me back to the description screen. I don't think it's because of Internet connection since I can use other apps just fine. I also tried the clear cache/data, uninstall and re-installed, but the still getting the same problem."

"Fix the issue with brightness overriding the phone brightness, watching anything on the app in a dark room is like melting your eyes even though the brightness is all the way down from the app. Just completely remove it and let the brightness be handle by the phone itself."

"Membership is not starting. Really frustrated by this. I have tried again and again but It keeps showing this error. ""Sorry, something went wrong. Please try again later"". Fix this as soon as possible."
It's very nice film drama and story app I really like it
Like app. Wish loading content was faster or that there were some cool innovative features like recommending video with other users or watching video with someone somewhere else at the same time. Xbox app used to do that.
Needs more improvement in primary account Like 1 Netflix account is the primary and all other linked with it should not give the settings and account details or mange devices access. And like a setting to set primary location. These changes are important On next update please implement these.
I like this app I have 5 star in your apps
Good
"Can't this be free with ads? üôÇ I couldn't make any online payment methods like using credit cards because i am not that rich, so i had to disable it. if this was free by showing ads, i think it would be better."

"Stopped working for my Android Smart TV with built-in Chromecast. They misrepresent business/legal strategies, as if they're some technical issues - unethical. If one has to do a sanguinary interdisciplinary PhD research before buying a Smart TV to know when Netflix will stop working, Netflix should pay, instead of increasing subscription costs, let alone asking money for it! At least make the subscription device-type-specific, as watching on a phone/laptop isn't the same as watching on TV."
Fanatical the best yes
"In 2 months it was working fine . But , after that it is not working properly from 3 day And it is not opening. Whenever I click on Netflix logo .

"More than UI, the selection of movies from hollywood is going down in Netflix. Some user friendly UI tips: 1. Anyway to avoid who is watching screen at the startup ? Each person in household has a mobile nowadays. 2. Avoid the brightness settings option in watch screen unless user selects it as an option ? A similar volume slider will be helpful. 3. Take cue from competitors and adopt best ideas. See Amazon Prime app and get ideas."

This is just sad

This was awesome app
You dont respond to comments in reviews. That proves you dont care. Well your not going to force un-needed updates on me. The old U.I was is better. This doesnt work. Turned auto uodates off! Refuse to update the app. If security becomes problem Will cancel service. Already ive stopped uninstalled F.B for privacy violations and updates.

the best Netflix
They are stealing our culture
Regardless of the full support for homosexuality and intentionally insulting religious beliefs history falsification is a harmful practice that has many negative consequences. It is important to be aware of these consequences and to work to ensure that history is taught accurately.
Please restore the old version. I just updated the app and when I started watching all it gave me was an awful experience by stopping every now and then üòîüòî
Netflix! congrats on being dishonest fake info distributer and against human nature supporter. Shame on you Netflix people.
Distortion of History
"The recent update (which sucks majorly anyway) has made it impossible for me to cast to my Chromecast. Despite spending hours troubleshooting, Netflix support was unhelpful, and the representative had difficulty understanding English or what a Chromecast is. They made me repeat the same troubleshooting steps, and now I cannot watch Netflix on my TV. I was eventually told it would be escalated and I would not be notified if it is resolved. I'll give it a few days before cancelining but ‚úåÔ∏è"
There is such a disgusting movies and series !

"Worst app ever as it not only provides homosexual shows and movies like its at all normal, but also it started supporting and creating content about false historical events such as their support to the false ideology of the Afrocentric in the to be released movie called ""Queen Cleopatra"" where they show her to be black, when it was already scientifically proven with DNA that all ancient Egyptians had the exact same skin colour the current Egyptians have, and not black.."
App update puts you on explore page. That's a terrible UI. Please revert or give me the option to not be annoyed by your spam. Canceling is easier than you think. Lots of other options. How do I give this 0? You now have the app make an annoying noise when I open. My phone is on silent for a reason. Stop.
Good ...................
Telling lies about Cleopatra
Netflix has removed the option of forced subtitles or displaying translations in CC mode which makes it pointless to watch a lot of content. The UI is very buggy when trying to edit the watchlist.

The update for mobile is garbage. No more continue watching. Scrolling through is no longer seamless because it's trying to immediately start a trailer for everything you scroll by. Insane amount of scrolling just to see one option at a time instead of a few. It's ridiculous.

"I refuse to support the cause of the afro-synthetic who visits the Egyptian civilization in favor of the Africans, pretending in front of everyone that they are Egyptians. This is because it is disrespectful to the history and culture of Egypt. Egypt is a country with a rich and diverse history, and it is important to respect that. By pretending to be Egyptian, the afro-synthetic is erasing the history and culture of the real Egyptians."
Love the shows
Good
Worthless is an understatement...
stop appropriating our Egyptian history and heritage
Its ok
Please let me use the app in English language in Brasil
The app keeps on crashing every time I try to open it again and again.
"I love netflix, its great for watching movies and you dont have to pay for anything :)"
Cancel Cleopatra documentary
Don't try to steal our civilization. You are just a copy. Egypt for Egyptian. Don't mess with us. again.Nyahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahaha
Why is this app hard to download
"Netflix refund my ‚Ç¶2900 please, you haven't refunded me back my ‚Ç¶2900."
Egypt for Egyptians
No to afrocentric
All Netflix users just want back the old version We all just hate this latest version... Internet is not available on Everytime n at everywhere... There's no download option in this version..üôÑYou need to give us back last versions options... üòèüòè
So sweet
The company is getting greedy. You are not that important in peoples lives. Selection is becoming very mid. Morbius was #1 and takes the worst superhero movie ever. Do better we got more important suff to buy like milk and eggs
Too bright even at lowest bright setting. For some reason the brightness cant be adjusted as low as your phone
Since the new layout I haven't watched it on my phone it is ridiculously hard to navigate and by far the worst streaming app I use
I like Netflix but I wish there was a yearly option like some of the other apps have. It'll be way easier for some of us. Other than that it's a really get app on the go and for at home!

"As much as I want to give it a 5 it's very messed up when I leave, and then I pause it, and then when I come back, it says that there's a problem, and I can't fix the problem, so I have to exit out Netflix close it, and then I have to go back, it's very annoying and everytime I pause it and I click it again to unpause it, then it has a problem."
It's fantastic
Uu
It's a very great and awesome app
It's crashing a lot right after opening fix please
The app has a glitch
Fun
"Netflix is promoting history faking, trying to steel the Egyptian history by their new movie, I will cancel my subscription immediately"
I am tired of uninstalling and installing the app whenever it crashes...it wasn't like this!please fix this asap
Good but not that good On my phone it works without a problem but on my tablets it starts saying unable to play sometimes I will have to uninstall the app and reinstall it for it to work
Love this
"I did not expect such a terrible app from Netflix. I will try to install it a second time, because it just crashed, also couldn't watch videos in high quality, dk why. Besides, it doesn't have a section with the shows I'm watching now, which is very inconvenient. But some obscure game ads are immediately visible, great job!"
"Making everyone black and changing history? No thanks, Disney + and HBO max it is"
Very nice aap
very bad. it's the worst app
Very good!!! I love it and so good quality
It doesn't allow to view Your downloads offline. When money expires.

"They expose everything that contains falsification of facts and history, and support special policies that are far from providing art and entertainment"

"Most of the five star reviews I've seen are one or two vague words like ""Nice app"". Guess it's good all of these pictureless profiles are showing their vague support as Netflix removes important features for legitimate users to make life harder for these password sharers I've never met."
"I can't keep downloading the app whenever I want to open the app, I've downloaded it more than 5 times"
"Netflix is doing nothing but destroying communities, falsifying history & Egyptian heritage, promoting pedophilia."
Easy.
Too good
I can't log in other people can using the same email and password but I can't it's just not working

It's generally a good app.
"Last update was the worst update ever , i will stop my subscription from next month, the speed was too slow. Due to speed only i paid subscription money to Netflix otherwise i could see the contents of it from any pirate source. The update is worst , and also recommending other not to pay for Netflix."
The new update is horrible

Doesn't even deserve a star
"Can't even open the app without it instantly booting me back to the home screen, and I've tried several things to fix it but nope"
Why does it have games category?? That is non sense.. Instead Reels of movie and TV show parts were good to explore.
False documentary regarding un Egyptian queen
I dislike your app.
Bekar Automatic app close and back to home screen Very disturbing

"Absolute joke of an app and a company, full of minority and political agenda, absolutely disgusting experience and a disgusting company."
If I could give this racist and disgusting application less than 1 star I would.
I have subscribed to Netflix since the very beginning. But I finally canceled my subscription. A lot of shows are now only put out one episode a week. I absolutely hate this.
Great
Can't uninstall it on my Android phone.

Very good
The best tv platform to exist
It would have been a 4 but I hqve a problem with this; why do my downloaded series keep disappearing from the Download Section? Do you know how frustrating it is to have downloaded a whole 2 season and unable to watch cos it disappeared? This is not the first time this is happening. Data is expensive in Nigeria so stop wasting it! Fix up please. It is painful

It's gone stop after playing few sec
This new update doesn't even let me access Netflix on my phone. I click on it and am immediately taken out of the app it's terrible
The app is nice but i have to keep deleting it and downloading it over and over again to watch something.
Bad
Uninstalled!!! If you end password sharing feature then that will be the end of Netflix in India. I hope you won't put more holes on a sinking ship.
Horrible interface
Don't know history. Cleopatra was Greek and Macedonian not black

"The app keeps crashing after a few hours usage until I uninstall and re-install, rinse and repeat, not a good experience at all. First time user on Netflix and I've not even used it for up to 24hrs in total, terrible and disappointing experience."
Biased opinions in documentaries
"What a poor service. Very bad experience, I just logged in with recharge but after entering app is disappearing everytime. I cleared my app history still unable to open. Very disappointing"

When I see you, I'm going to watch nice movies and soap operas, but I've got stinky and stupid things in it, and this is also a dangerous thing for children I am Egyptian, I have experienced the history of all of Egypt, and you will come to make us disgusted with it in the evening, the last of the Cleopatra series bruh"

I have never tried it before buh after using it I will come back to re-rate it

Thanks for sweet series but why no offers
"I dont know if its just me, but I have Uninstaller Netflix 3 times now , because it keeps crossing on its own when I try to get on it doesn't say anything about why its doing so."
"A promoter of rumors, lies and falsification of history"
It's a nice app
The app has to be re downloaded every time I wanna switch shows if they fix it I would give it more stars but I have had to redownload it like 15 times already

"How do I roll back this new update? It's awful! The landing page should be ""Continue watching"" why is that hidden after a banner which covers 90% of my screen under ""Explore"" It's dysfunctional. The graphics dept. needs to settle down and think about the user. Who approved this?! The wrong casting and now this bloody update!"
The app always force close
I don't want this app to control my brightness
I hate the new interface!
Can you upgrade the subtitles? Like put some border or shadow?? Because whenever the background is light color the subtitles vanishes/unreadable
Netflix is amazing but I'm mad because they took demon Slayer season 3 off of it was coming out May 1st I've been waiting and waiting at and now I hear someone coming out now like Netflix please put demon Slayer season 3 back on Netflix please please üôèüèæü•∫ I want to see what happens just like Henry danger didn't put the rest of the season on Netflix and iCarly and danger Force get some shows don't make all the shows I just named you can see them on YouTube and other episodes.

I like watching Netflix it keeps me occupied
"Slow descent into mediocrity. I've had Netflix for 9 years and it used to be more than worth the cost. We only ever used two screens so, since Netflix encouraged it, we shared our account with family. But with the ever increasing cost, ever dwindling of content worth watching, and new crackdown on passwords, this has become a service more expensive than it is worth. My last day of subscription is in 2 days and I am not coming back without major improvements to the service."

I love Netflix but this app is horrible ever since the update I haven't even been able to enter the app I would open it click on my profile and then it would kick me out of the app I've tried uninstalling is I've tried restarting my phone NOTHING works I'm really disappointed in this update
I love Netflix. Just stop taking off stuff.

Your application is not responding if you exit the app after you watched and not used for half a minute.You need to re install for you to able to use again
"So bad app, cant find good movies"

Am disappointed that almost all the programing has turned into foreign stuff and half of it isn't even dubbed in English why is this when the largest language use in north America is American English sad to see this is what I pay even more for than I did when they didn't have all this not saying the content isn't ok just wish they would focus more on what viewers in this country want than what politics want

Definitely out to steal your money I canceled my Netflix subscription 6 hours before putting money in my bank account. They took the money that I had for my phone bill and then told me that because I had only canceled it a few hours before putting my money in the account that they were entitled to my money and then I wasn't guaranteed to get it back in time to pay my phone bill. BAN NETFLIX
Best platform to watch movies & shows.
"Netflix change me a lot,it makes me feel better,no problem I'm at home with my family enjoying the time together and with Netflix"
"The app sucks. Cannot watch my shows with wifi, or mobile. Cannot watch shows from my own account on which I pay the bill and am the only user and only one device is powered on."

"Facing worst. Netflix India should make all Tamil, Telugu, Kannada and Malayalam movies available in Hindi dubbed as well. I stopped 20 days and started the subscription again but the situation still did not improve. Now if Hindi dubbed will not be available, I will delete it permanently."
"I cancelled the subscription as I am fed up of the historical revisionism and the art of cinematography being subjugated by an agenda. Most of the shows and the characters are predictable and boring, I am not going to support this company with my money."

Used to be great now it's no better than Blockbuster.
It's very bad and ugly experience. Netflix wants to falsify our Egyptian history claiming that Cleopatra is from African ansistors and Egyptians are black colors as a part for their afrocentric movement but it is not true because history proves that Cleopatra is from Macedonian empire and we Egyptians are not part of African history. We are Egyptians have our great history which is not part of any country. We are proud of that.

"This is a joke, old shows getting canceled only to put indian films more, this is abdolute garbage, do better netflix"
The Netflix originals have gone down the toilet. There's only a couple shows that are worth watching on Netflix now. The rest you can get anywhere else. They have no variety in content and most of the stuff that they create themselves is just garbage. Also the password sharing thing where they said they weren't going to do and then they did. It was kind of a scam. So since you're paying outrageous prices for nothing.

Loved this app as it provides such a amazing content
Streaming was cool a lots of choice however installed one day ago and app is automatically stopped when I just opened and when instantly clokc on the movie it goes back to close the app.
Love it
I need to catch every action in time.
"Why is it Netflix doesn't have full English subtitles without CC? Also, why do Netflix push an agenda with a completely unrealistic number of trans/gay/coloured/etc. people in movies where they don't fit? Like in Witcher(Poland). They were white. And Cleopatra in a documentary is now black while in reality she was Greek! What's next, Denzel Washington starring as Trump? It is never the other way around. Stop it!!"
Not Good
Baaaaad!!
"It's not about the app or the movies i used to like Netflix , At first, you think that Netflix encourages difference and respect for others, but now it appears how they promote their ideas and attack the ideas, culture, and civilization of other people."
I used to like netflix untill 2 things 1-you guys decided to false history make ancient egypt look black ? seriously ? who do you think you are kidding ? 2- almost every show had to force lgbt scenes out of nowhere

"zero rate Netflix is trying to force strange and broken values on our kids and us. It is falsifying history by transforming a white woman from Macedonia Greece, into a woman of African descent. What else will you do? Stop destroying humanity and history. Shame on you. We know what you are trying to do and what your agendas are. Egypt is for Egyptians only. Egypt's civilization was built by Egyptians only."
You are falsifying the history of Egypt by making a hilarious short series about Queen Cleopatra which is her origin from Greek and not a black African one .. Never rewrite a falso history about Egypt .. black Africans didn't build Egypt ..as Egyptains we are against afrocentric movement you adopt Egypt will be forever for the Egyptains.

Worst UI for a OTT streaming platform. I wonder why the subscription plans of this plan are so high compared to other OTT apps. This app only shows suggested content in the main page. Everytime I need to continue watching my show I need to go to 'My list'. Also there is no filter option for genres that I want to see before starting a new show. Need to keep searching for it everytime which is frustrating.

queen cleopatra ÿå falsification of history üò°üëé
Washes the history with in correct info like Cleplopatra being black under Documentary genre which is not true
"So bad experience but the worst It's An application that promotes immoral things by broadcasting them, in addition to producing serials that falsify history"
For false movies about Egypt üá™üá¨
Netflix supports falsification and backwashing history
Disgusting afrocentric ideasü§¢
I rate this app Three star cause Sometimes it Always gives excuse Saying Can't download this app Movie but it pretty cool
Netflix creates fantacy movies and describe it as historical movies as queen cliopatra it'sn't the true story
Egypt for Egyptians
Can't watch it at night because it completely takes over my brightness to the point where it's eye searing. This problem has been there for years. Dissapointing that it's not been fixed.

"Changes to app, looking like a social media app: What was the bright idea to simplify the app to look like instagram or tiktok, it's annoying. Why can I just click on home, games, search and downloads. It's a horrible change. I don't want to see the games and I want the old feedback. This is awful."
Better
Very bad experience
falsification of history
"Cleopatra wasn't black , they are producing fake documentaries without any historical evidence , we've got to stop this nonsense."
U r stealing our history (fake documentary Cleopatra film) CLEOPATRA WAS AN EGYPTIAN QUEEN
You are faking the history
"I dislike Netflix because it shows fake documentaries to steal Egyptian history and falsify the truth, Remove app forever."
Stealing culture
"Distortion of history. You're stealing our history and defending yourselves saying that we are being racist but the truth is you are all a bunch of losers who's doing nothing but falsifying the truth. Next time try investing more money in research, as a change, might save you all the hassle"
The new update launched in April 2023 makes navigating and casting more complicated. The previous version was much easier to operate
Falsing history

They falsify the facts
You guys need to check your historical facts you should remove documentary word from the Cleopatra show coz it's not it's fiction üòí
History-fraud content produced by Netflix attributing the origin of Ancient Egyptian population to the black race. Shame on you.
Falsifying history..And calling it a documentary
Nice

"You need to do more research before releasing a documentary series supporting pseudoscience like the ""Ancient Apocalypse"" series. Your documentaries lack the correct research and correct input data."
Queen Cleopatra is not a Netflix Decomentry. It is Egypt History. It can't be filmed by foreigners who don't have a full knowledge about Egypt!!
yeah great
Not worth it
Very bad experiance
Fake documentaries.
Changing our Egyption history and made us invaders
I can't open the on my phone.
Expired movies and shows.. Paying for nothing..
Adopting false and misleading facts about history and cultures . Falsifying history and very biased points of views.. shame on Netflix
"Falsified information, Her majesty the Egyptian Queen was NOT Afro Stop spreading Afro centrism"
"Queen Cleopatra is Egyptian, her skin is white. We are not black. Stop stealing our civilization and our history"
The worst platform ever
It is good it work for me I updated ot and it have games too
Nice app
"Most of the series are dubbed when i saw them ,but if i want to repeat any of them the dubbed version is gone ,if it's a glitch then please fix it"
That was one of the most disgusting experiences i had ever been through Those people support everything that's wrong They try to fake everything thing in their documentaries Cleopatra is black?! Who are you to fake a history of thousands years just to follow afrocentrism agenda We won't allow
Entertaining and thrilling
Well please add more anime series much needed
"You are disrespectful and you are trying to level the reputation of the Arab countries, and I hate you so much"

Netflix created a disgrace of a documentary about Egyptian History. Shame on you for doing this and trying to manipulate history!

Bekar hai
After updating it's become WORST.. FOR WHAT UPDATE..... ITS BECOME COMPLICATED AFTER UPDATE...
From Egypt
"Please find positivity every Time always mind clear,there after life very running smoothly"
Misinformation and rewriting history
Just unsubscribed after watching Cleopatra trailer. can't take this anymore. falsifying history just for inclusion is just pathetic.
Very bad
You guys falsify history.
Very bad experience account email
"It's a very nice movie and series app. But the fact that you can't share account with friends and family around you is just a downside for Netflix. They will lose a lot of people by doing so, but I guess thats their choice of action. If someone is new to this app (which I would be surprised), I would consider it if you are willing to pay CA$20 a month or around there. Otherwise, find a free app. I use Netflix everyday. But unfortunately it doesn't even have all the movies I want."
So bad tbh
EGYPT for Egyptian
Innacurate racial depictions in the shows.
"Worst update, have to uninstall app and reinstall to get app to work again"
Weird documentaries with false history details
Cleopatra negra en documental üòÇüòÇ que verg√ºenza.. que fuman üòÇ

I love it
"Awesome experience, full on entertainment. Like this streaming app (Netflix). Although a good app. Thanks"
App is not working. I am not able to open the app in my phone

Exceptional!!üëå
This is a very good app for watching web series and more
"A company driven by a special agenda, I'm glad that I cancelled my subscription"
Super
The worst platform ever. It has its own agenda and twists facts to reach its own goals. No credibility at all

"Thieves of civilization!! After centuries of oppression of blacks in America and Europe, you want black ppl to trust u again and that you aren't reactionary By stealing the great civilization of Egypt?! The Ancient Egyptians WERE NOT BLACK Its not discrimination this's the truth, search the amazing Tutankhamun's shoes, the images of blacks,Phoenicians and Assyrians on his shoes as an indication of the enemies of the King Do not let those who enslaved u do it again by enslaved ur mind"
Goox

"Faking documentaries, supporting weird movements to narrate falsified history."
App crashing after update
Forging Egyptian history
false documentary
Koooi
Zero stars as Netflix doesn't deserve the same ... Waste of money
"Netflix seems to go the extra mile to make the Android Netflix experience as painful as possible. Unpredictable logging of watched/unwatched content. No FF/skip forward when casting content. It never seems to improve. They also cancel good shows at random. They recently added a feature making it impossible to cast to Chromecasts, because ""ideally, our paying customers should not be able to easily watch the content on their TVs""."
Good
Egyptian aren't black
Promotes false information and documentaries without digging deep into the history of things.
Not uninstall in mobile
"Terrible, It says that cleopatra was African when in reality she was a Greek who ruled egypt the ancient egyptian civilization was egyptain"
Accused of falsifying Egyptian history and Black washing it.
Eeeh
Terrible app keeps crashing after the sart up logo animation
U guys are saying that Cleopatra was a black girl I'm not racist anymore but Egyptians was a white skin
I love it
